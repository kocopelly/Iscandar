# Overview
## Governments
### Storm Confederacy:

1.  Elemental council: The Storm Confederacy's ruling council is composed of representatives from each of the four elemental factions â€“ air, earth, fire, and water. Each faction has its own unique attire, symbols, and traditions, which are prominently displayed during council meetings and public events.
2.  Trial by elements: When a significant decision needs to be made, the Storm Confederacy may call for a "Trial by Elements," where each elemental faction presents its case and champions engage in a ceremonial contest that represents the element's strength and wisdom.
3.  Elemental ambassadors: In order to promote harmony and understanding between the different elemental factions, the Storm Confederacy encourages the exchange of "elemental ambassadors" who live and work in other regions for a set period of time, learning and sharing their unique elemental knowledge.

### Council of Tides:

1.  Waterborne council meetings: The Council of Tides holds its meetings on floating platforms or specially designed underwater chambers, symbolizing the importance of water and Aquarion's influence in their governance.
2.  Ceremonial conch shells: Council members each possess a ceremonial conch shell, which they use to signal the start of meetings, call for order, or announce important decisions. The shells are intricately carved and often passed down through generations.
3.  Tide-touched advisors: The Council of Tides includes a select group of individuals known as "Tide-touched," who are believed to have been blessed by Aquarion with unique insights and prophetic abilities. These advisors provide spiritual guidance and help to shape the council's decisions, often through cryptic messages and visions.

## Other Factions
### Wardens of Aquarion 
Aquarion's Wardens are an elite and secretive group of individuals chosen by Aquarion himself to carry out his will and protect the people of Tidewhisper Shores. These Wardens possess unique powers and abilities granted by Aquarion, making them formidable allies and feared opponents. Their primary mission is to safeguard the people from threats both within and beyond Tidewhisper Shores. In the aftermath of the war, the Wardens have taken on a more proactive role, venturing into the splintered Cinderspire Expanse to provide aid, protect refugees, and promote peace. As a small and esoteric group, the Wardens operate in the shadows, executing covert missions and working tirelessly to maintain stability in the region.
### Iron Guild 
In the early days of the Cinderspire Expanse, iron-working was a closely guarded secret known only to Pyrothar. The mighty dragon would forge weapons and armor for his most loyal followers, but he refrained from teaching the skill to the people to maintain his control over the region.

As tensions escalated and the war approached, Pyrothar found it necessary to increase the production of weapons and armor for his forces. Reluctantly, he taught a select few fire mages the art of iron-working. Unbeknownst to Pyrothar, some of these mages held loyalties to the stability of the realm rather than to the dragon himself.

These fire mages covertly formed the Iron Guild, with a mission to democratize iron-working and promote the greater good. They secretly spread their knowledge to other regions, providing opposition forces with the means to forge their own weapons and armor. The Iron Guild played a crucial role in maintaining the balance of power during the war and contributed to the eventual retreat of Pyrothar.
### Emberstone Society 
The Emberstone Society is a secretive group of scholars, alchemists, and mages in the Cinderspire Expanse, focused on the study of fire magic and the preservation of knowledge. Though they maintain a low profile, the Emberstone Society played a crucial role in the war, providing magical support and sharing vital information with the allied forces against Pyrothar and his followers.
### Emberhold Council
The Emberhold Council was once a powerful governing body in the Cinderspire Expanse, focused on maintaining the stability and prosperity of the region. Comprised of influential leaders from various cities and settlements across the expanse, the council members worked together to make decisions that affected the entire region. However, with the splintering of the Cinderspire Expanse following the war and the departure of Pyrothar, the Emberhold Council has struggled to maintain its authority.

In the post-war era, remnants of the Emberhold Council still exist in isolated pockets throughout the region, attempting to reestablish order and unity. These factions are often at odds with the Pyroclastic Order and other emerging power groups, as they seek to establish a more balanced rule and lessen the dependence on draconic influence. While the Emberhold Council no longer has a dedicated military force, some factions maintain alliances with local militias or remnants of the Iron Guild to protect their interests and maintain what little power they still possess.
