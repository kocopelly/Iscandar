# The Backstory of Iscandar

##  The Forgotten History: Genetic Ark
> [!column|no-t]
> Iscandar is a sort of "genetic ark" created by a long-extinct advanced civilization. The creation of the genetic Ark, containing the seeds of various humanoid races, is believed to be a project of the [[Nexus of Echolalia]]. It is hypothesized that this could be a result of the Nexus's inherent curiosity about biological life or a project stemming from their pre-Ascension era. The Ark was sent into the cosmos, eventually ending up in the realm of Iscandar.

> 
> 1.  **Ancient Ruins**: The players could find structures older than any known civilization, showing advanced technology far beyond anything currently available. These ruins could be buried deep in the earth, hidden deep in the ocean, or even floating in the sky. They might contain undecipherable scripts, strange symbols, or advanced machinery. 
> 2.  **Artifacts of Unknown Origin**: Players may come across unusual devices or items with abilities that seem magical but are actually technological. These could be remnants of the advanced technology used by the Saurians, and deciphering their use could offer glimpses into the world's past. 
> 3.  **Automated Systems Still Running**: Players could encounter automated systems that are still functioning, such as drones patrolling a specific route, automated farming machinery, or an AI-controlled lab still conducting its research. These could provide hints at the world's origin and the level of technology that once existed. 
> 4.  **Genetic Anomalies**: The players might discover creatures with strange genetic traits that can't be explained by natural evolution. This could hint at the genetic manipulation that was involved in the creation of Iscandar's inhabitants. 
> 5.  **Encoded Messages**: Players could find encoded messages or signals being transmitted from hidden stations across the world. These signals could be a form of Saurian communication or a distress signal sent out when the catastrophe happened. 
> 6.  **Unusual Star Maps**: As Iscandar was a relocated planet, star maps would not align with the current constellations. Scholars and astronomers could be puzzled over the mismatch, leading to a potential discovery of Iscandar's true origins. 
> 7.  **Persistent Legends and Myths**: Stories passed down through generations about the 'Gods' who came from the sky and created life could be based on half-remembered histories of the Saurians. 
> 8.  **Strange Environmental Features**: Certain aspects of Iscandar's environment might be remnants of terraforming efforts, such as unnaturally perfect mountains or oddly uniform forests. 
> 9.  **Saurian Observers**: The Saurians might still be observing Iscandar from afar. The players could notice strange phenomena like unexplainable lights in the sky, or even have brief encounters with the observers themselves. 
> 10.  **Recurring Technological Symbols**: Certain symbols or designs might recur in the ancient technology found throughout the world, serving as a sort of 'maker's mark' left behind by the Saurians.

## The Early History: Emergence of the Dragons

> [[6. Lore/Non Player Characters/The Great Dragons/Aquarion|Aquarion]] 
> Aquarion, the water dragon, took residence in the Tidewhisper shores. This creature of immense power was benevolent and nurturing, guiding the development of the humanoid species along the coastline. The marine races flourished under Aquarion's guidance.
> 
> [[6. Lore/Non Player Characters/The Great Dragons/Tempestar|Tempestar]] 
> Tempestar, the storm dragon, settled in the Stormhaven Plateau. Despite its distant nature, it formed a symbiotic mentorship with the species of the plateau. The humanoids and Tempestar learned much from each other, leading to the development of unique technologies. 
> 
> [[6. Lore/Non Player Characters/The Great Dragons/Pyrothar|Pyrothar]] 
> Pyrothar, the fire dragon, claimed the Cinderspire Expanse as his domain. Unlike the others, Pyrothar ruled with an iron fist. His authoritarian regime led to strict control over technology and knowledge, creating a society built on fear and obedience.

> 
> These dragons, representatives of a highly advanced reptilian civilization, genetically and cybernetically enhanced themselves for reasons unknown to the common inhabitants of Iscandar. The humanoids living under their influence perceived their abilities as magical properties, further bolstering the dragons' status as near-deities in the world.

>> [!note] Meta Information
>> The dragons' origins are a closely guarded secret, known only to a few. Their technological enhancements allow them to manipulate elements in ways that appear magical, but in reality are the result of highly advanced scientific processes.

## The Great War

>[!column| 3 no-t]
>![[War_Scene.jpg]]
>
>Pyrothar, unsatisfied with his domain, sought to expand his control over the entire world. This sparked a great war, pitting the territories of the dragons against each other. Pyrothar, in his ambition, began importing off-world mercenaries to assist in his conquest, escalating the conflict to unprecedented levels. The inhabitants of Iscandar, previously unaware of life beyond their world, were now exposed to the terrifying reality of interstellar warfare.
>
>The war ended with Pyrothar's defeat. However, instead of accepting his loss, Pyrothar fled off-world, leaving Iscandar in a state of disarray. His departure caused a power vacuum, leading to a power struggle amongst the emerging factions. This struggle is still ongoing, with no clear dominant power.

>> Pyrothar's departure is public knowledge, but his exact whereabouts remain unknown. Rumors circulate about his return, creating a sense of unease and anticipation.

## The Aftermath and the Current State

><br>Following Pyrothar's departure, the off-world mercenaries split into different factions. Some stayed behind, offering their services to the highest bidder, while others remained loyal to Pyrothar, maintaining a vague contact with the ousted dragon in hopes of his return.
>A technocult of off-world origin also emerged, working with Pyrothar during the war. In the current state, they seek to unravel the secrets of the old world and use them to shape the new. Their activities are shrouded in mystery, fueling rumors and speculations among the inhabitants of Iscandar.
