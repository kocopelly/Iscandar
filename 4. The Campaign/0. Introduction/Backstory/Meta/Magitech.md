**1. Mixed Magic Setting**

In a mixed magic setting, the technology left behind by the advanced civilizations is plentiful, but not all of it is equally accessible or powerful. This could create a society where 'magic' is common but varies greatly in power.

For example, many inhabitants might have access to basic 'cantrips' â€“ small pieces of technology that allow for minor feats like lighting fires, cleaning surfaces, or creating minor illusions. These could be everyday items in households, remnants of a past civilization, like a lighter or a dishwasher might be in our world. These might be used without a full understanding of their mechanisms.

However, more potent 'spells' or technological marvels would be rarer and harder to control. These could be relics locked away in ancient ruins, guarded by dangerous creatures or environmental hazards. For instance, a staff that shoots fireballs could be a piece of military technology, or a ring of invisibility could be a piece of advanced stealth tech.

**2. The Unaware Majority**

Most magic users in this world might understand their powers in a traditional fantasy context. They might view their powers as blessings from the gods, inherent magical talent, or the result of arcane study. In truth, their abilities could be the result of advanced technology or genetic manipulation.

For instance, a 'wizard' might believe they are casting spells through the arcane language of creation, whereas they are actually activating and commanding nanobots left behind by the ancient civilization. They might learn 'spells' by discovering old command codes and mistaking them for magical incantations.

As for cultural narrative, the inhabitants of this world could have constructed elaborate mythologies and religious beliefs around these misunderstood technologies. The ancient advanced civilizations could be viewed as gods or mythical ancestors, their technology seen as divine relics.

**3. Becoming a Member of a Class**

The method by which a character becomes a member of a class can vary widely, and it can be a combination of factors including birth, training, and circumstance.

-   **Birth**: Some characters, like Sorcerers, might be born with their powers due to genetic manipulation or exposure to advanced technology during their mother's pregnancy. They might have a natural ability to interface with and manipulate the technology around them.
    
-   **Training**: Other characters might learn to use their powers through intense study or mentorship. A 'wizard', for instance, could learn 'spell codes' from ancient texts or a mentor. A Fighter or Monk could undergo physical and mental training to unlock the potential of their enhancements.
    
-   **Circumstance**: Some characters might stumble upon their powers. For instance, a Warlock might accidentally form a pact with a powerful entity, while a Rogue might find and figure out how to use a piece of stealth tech.
    

The characters would not necessarily need to be aware of the sci-fi backing. They might interpret their powers in a way that fits the world's prevalent cultural and religious narratives. For instance, a Cleric might believe they are channeling the power of a god, not realizing that they're using ancient technology.

### Order of the Tidewhisper

**Meta description**: Many rituals and 'magic' seen in the Order of the Tidewhisper are accomplished through the use of advanced hydro and bio-tech. The "language of the sea" they learn to practice magic is, in fact, a system of commands for nanobots present in the water. These nanobots can manipulate water and create various effects that seem magical to the uninitiated. For instance, their healing magic might involve nanobots accelerating cellular regeneration, while their divination could be based on predictive models run by an AI analyzing vast amounts of data.

### Circle of the Storm

**Meta description**: The members of the Circle unknowingly use weather-controlling technology leftover from Saurian times. Their rituals to predict and control the weather are actually accessing and issuing commands to an ancient weather control system. Their "magic" often involves electro-tech, using devices that can generate or manipulate electricity and static charges, which is perceived as storm or lightning magic. For instance, their ability to "summon storms" might be due to activating weather-modifying satellites or geo-engineering machines.

### Pyroclastic Order

**Meta description**: The Pyroclastic Order unknowingly use advanced pyro-tech and energy manipulation devices. Their rituals often involve the use of these devices to control and create fire or heat-based phenomena. For instance, their "fire magic" is often the result of high-energy plasma manipulation using Saurian technology. They might have devices that can cause spontaneous combustion or manipulate thermal energy, creating illusions of fire manipulation and immunity. Their intimidation tactics might involve controlled use of these devices to demonstrate their "divine" power.
