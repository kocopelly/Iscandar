Centuries ago, Iscandar was a world inhabited by an array of genetically engineered species, their origins and the nature of their existence obscured by the mists of time and myth. The world was divided into regions, each with its own unique challenges and wonders, and the inhabitants lived in relative harmony, guided and protected by the three mighty Dragons: Aquarion, Tempestar, and Pyrothar.

Aquarion, the Water Dragon, resided in the Tidewhisper shores, nurturing and fostering the life that sprouted along its bountiful coasts. Tempestar, the Storm Dragon, made its home atop the Stormhaven Plateau, forming a distant but symbiotic relationship with the people there, teaching them to harness the power of the storm and sky. Pyrothar, the Fire Dragon, ruled over the Cinderspire Expanse with an iron fist, demanding obedience and respect from the inhabitants of its fiery domain.

This balance was shattered when Pyrothar, fueled by ambition, ignited a war to rule over all of Iscandar. To support his conquest, Pyrothar brought in off-world mercenaries, fearsome warriors with advanced technology and brutal tactics. The war raged on, leaving scars on the land and its people that would never fully heal. However, through a united effort, the inhabitants of Iscandar managed to defeat Pyrothar, forcing the Fire Dragon to flee off-world.

With Pyrothar gone, the world of Iscandar was left in a state of flux. The power vacuum left by the Fire Dragon's departure allowed new factions to emerge, each seeking to shape Iscandar in their own image. The off-world mercenaries, their contract with Pyrothar rendered void, split into different groups. Some sold their services to these rising powers, while others remained loyal to Pyrothar, maintaining vague contact with their exiled leader.

Amidst this struggle for power, a technocult also emerged, a group fascinated by the remnants of advanced technology left behind by Pyrothar. They began to unravel the secrets of this technology, seeking to wield it as a tool to control Iscandar. Unbeknownst to many, this technocult was not just interested in power, but also in the return of Pyrothar, whom they saw as the rightful ruler of Iscandar.

Now, as the world of Iscandar is caught in a dangerous dance of power, the future is uncertain. The inhabitants must navigate this new era, one where the immediate threat is the power struggle among the new factions, but where a far greater danger looms in the shadows - the potential return of Pyrothar.
