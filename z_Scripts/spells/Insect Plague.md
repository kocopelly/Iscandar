description: "Swarming, biting locusts fill a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a\
    \ point you choose within range. The sphere spreads around corners. The sphere\
    \ remains for the duration, and its area is lightly obscured. The sphere\u2019\
    s area is difficult terrain.\nWhen the area appears, each creature in it must\
    \ make a Constitution saving throw. A creature takes 4d10 piercing damage on a\
    \ failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature must also\
    \ make this saving throw when it enters the spell\u2019s area for the first time\
    \ on a turn or ends its turn there.\n**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this\
    \ spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10\
    \ for each slot level above 5th."
