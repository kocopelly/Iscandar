    \ duration or until you cast this spell again. When you cast the spell, you can\
    \ make a melee spell attack against a creature within 5 feet of the weapon. On\
    \ a hit, the target takes force damage equal to 1d8 + your spellcasting ability\
    \ modifier.\nAs a bonus action on your turn, you can move the weapon up to 20\
    \ feet and repeat the attack against a creature within 5 feet of it.\nThe weapon\
    \ can take whatever form you choose. Clerics of deities who are associated with\
    \ a particular weapon (as St. Cuthbert is known for his mace and Thor for his\
    \ hammer) make this spell\u2019s effect resemble that weapon.\n**At Higher Levels.**\
    \ When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage\
    \ increases by 1d8 for every two slot levels above 2nd."
