description: "You mentally contact a demigod, the spirit of a long- dead sage, or\
    \ some other mysterious entity from another plane. Contacting this extraplanar\
    \ intelligence can strain or even break your mind. When you cast this spell, make\
    \ a DC 15 Intelligence saving throw. On a failure, you take 6d6 psychic damage\
    \ and are insane until you finish a long rest. While insane, you can\u2019t take\
    \ actions, can\u2019t understand what other creatures say, can\u2019t read, and\
    \ speak only in gibberish. A **greater restoration** spell cast on you ends this\
    \ effect.\nOn a successful save, you can ask the entity up to five questions.\
    \ You must ask your questions before the spell ends. The GM answers each question\
    \ with one word, such as \u201Cyes,\u201D \u201Cno,\u201D \u201Cmaybe,\u201D \u201C\
    never,\u201D \u201Cirrelevant,\u201D or \u201Cunclear\u201D (if the entity doesn\u2019\
    t know the answer to the question). If a one-word answer would be misleading,\
    \ the GM might instead offer a short phrase as an answer."
