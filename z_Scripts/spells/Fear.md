    \ creature in a 30-foot cone must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or drop whatever\
    \ it is holding and become frightened for the duration.\nWhile frightened by this\
    \ spell, a creature must take the Dash action and move away from you by the safest\
    \ available route on each of its turns, unless there is nowhere to move. If the\
    \ creature ends its turn in a location where it doesn\u2019t have line of sight\

    \ spell ends for that creature."
