description: "You place an illusion on a creature or an object you touch so that divination\
    \ spells reveal false information about it. The target can be a willing creature\
    \ or an object that isn\u2019t being carried or worn by another creature.\nWhen\
    \ you cast the spell, choose one or both of the following effects. The effect\
    \ lasts for the duration. If you cast this spell on the same creature or object\
    \ every day for 30 days, placing the same effect on it each time, the illusion\
    \ lasts until it is dispelled.\n**False Aura.** You change the way the target\
    \ appears to spells and magical effects, such as **detect magic**, that detect\
    \ magical auras**.** You can make a nonmagical object appear magical, a magical\
    \ object appear nonmagical, or change the object\u2019s magical aura so that it\
    \ appears to belong to a specific school of magic that you choose. When you use\
    \ this effect on an object, you can make the false magic apparent to any creature\
    \ that handles the item.\n**Mask.** You change the way the target appears to spells\
    \ and magical effects that detect creature types, such as a paladin\u2019s Divine\
    \ Sense or the trigger of a **symbol** spell. You choose a creature type and other\
    \ spells and magical effects treat the target as if it were a creature of that\
    \ type or of that alignment."
