concentration: true
description: "Choose an area of terrain no larger than 40 feet on a side within range.\
    \ You can reshape dirt, sand, or clay in the area in any manner you choose for\
    \ the duration. You can raise or lower the area\u2019s elevation, create or fill\
    \ in a trench, erect or flatten a wall, or form a pillar. The extent of any such\
    \ changes can\u2019t exceed half the area\u2019s largest dimension. So, if you\
    \ affect a 40-foot square, you can create a pillar up to 20 feet high, raise or\
    \ lower the square\u2019s elevation by up to 20 feet, dig a trench up to 20 feet\
    \ deep, and so on. It takes 10 minutes for these changes to complete.\nAt the\
    \ end of every 10 minutes you spend concentrating on the spell, you can choose\
    \ a new area of terrain to affect.\nBecause the terrain\u2019s transformation\
    \ occurs slowly, creatures in the area can\u2019t usually be trapped or injured\
    \ by the ground\u2019s movement.\nThis spell can\u2019t manipulate natural stone\
    \ or stone construction. Rocks and structures shift to accommodate the new terrain.\
    \ If the way you shape the terrain would make a structure unstable, it might collapse.\n\
    Similarly, this spell doesn\u2019t directly affect plant growth. The moved earth\
    \ carries any plants along with it."
