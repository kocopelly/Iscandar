description: "This spell transforms a creature that you can see within range into\
    \ a new form. An unwilling creature must make a Wisdom saving throw to avoid the\
    \ effect. The spell has no effect on a shapechanger or a creature with 0 hit points.\n\
    The transformation lasts for the duration, or until the target drops to 0 hit\
    \ points or dies. The new form can be any beast whose challenge rating is equal\
    \ to or less than the target\u2019s (or the target\u2019s level, if it doesn\u2019\
    t have a challenge rating). The target\u2019s game statistics, including mental\
    \ ability scores, are replaced by the statistics of the chosen beast. It retains\
    \ its alignment and personality.\nThe target assumes the hit points of its new\
    \ form. When it reverts to its normal form, the creature returns to the number\
    \ of hit points it had before it transformed. If it reverts as a result of dropping\
    \ to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to its normal form. As long\
    \ as the excess damage doesn\u2019t reduce the creature\u2019s normal form to\
    \ 0 hit points, it isn\u2019t knocked unconscious.\nThe creature is limited in\
    \ the actions it can perform by the nature of its new form, and it can\u2019t\
    \ speak, cast spells, or take any other action that requires hands or speech.\n\
    The target\u2019s gear melds into the new form. The creature can\u2019t activate,\
    \ use, wield, or otherwise benefit from any of its equipment."
