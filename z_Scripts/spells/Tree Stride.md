    \ You instantly know the location of all other trees of the same kind within 500\
    \ feet and, as part of the move used to enter the tree, can either pass into one\
    \ of those trees or step out of the tree you\u2019re in. You appear in a spot\
    \ of your choice within 5 feet of the destination tree, using another 5 feet of\
    \ movement. If you have no movement left, you appear within 5 feet of the tree\
    \ you entered.\nYou can use this transportation ability once per round for the\
    \ duration. You must end each turn outside a tree."
