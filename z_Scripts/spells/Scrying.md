description: "You can see and hear a particular creature you choose that is on the\
    \ same plane of existence as you. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw,\
    \ which is modified by how well you know the target and the sort of physical connection\
    \ you have to it. If a target knows you\u2019re casting this spell, it can fail\
    \ the saving throw voluntarily if it wants to be observed.\n**Secondhand (you\
    \ have heard of the target):** +5\n**Firsthand (you have met the target):** +0\n\
    **Familiar (you know the target well):** \u22125\n**Likeness or picture:** \u2212\
    2\n**Possession or garment:** \u22124\n**Body part, lock of hair, bit of nail,\
    \ or the like:** \u221210\nOn a successful save, the target isn\u2019t affected,\
    \ and you can\u2019t use this spell against it again for 24 hours.\nOn a failed\
    \ save, the spell creates an invisible sensor within 10 feet of the target. You\
    \ can see and hear through the sensor as if you were there. The sensor moves with\
    \ the target, remaining within 10 feet of it for the duration. A creature that\
    \ can see invisible objects sees the sensor as a luminous orb about the size of\
    \ your fist.\nInstead of targeting a creature, you can choose a location you have\
    \ seen before as the target of this spell. When you do, the sensor appears at\
    \ that location and doesn\u2019t move."
