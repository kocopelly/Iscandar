description: "You touch a stone object of Medium size or smaller or a section of stone\
    \ no more than 5 feet in any dimension and form it into any shape that suits your\
    \ purpose. So, for example, you could shape a large rock into a weapon, idol,\
    \ or coffer, or make a small passage through a wall, as long as the wall is less\
    \ than 5 feet thick. You could also shape a stone door or its frame to seal the\
    \ door shut. The object you create can have up to two hinges and a latch, but\
    \ finer mechanical detail isn\u2019t possible."
