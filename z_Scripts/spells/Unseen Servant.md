description: "This spell creates an invisible, mindless, shapeless force that performs\
    \ simple tasks at your command until the spell ends. The servant springs into\
    \ existence in an unoccupied space on the ground within range. It has AC 10, 1\
    \ hit point, and a Strength of 2, and it can\u2019t attack. If it drops to 0 hit\
    \ points, the spell ends.\nOnce on each of your turns as a bonus action, you can\
    \ mentally command the servant to move up to 15 feet and interact with an object.\
    \ The servant can perform simple tasks that a human servant could do, such as\
    \ fetching things, cleaning, mending, folding clothes, lighting fires, serving\
    \ food, and pouring wine. Once you give the command, the servant performs the\
    \ task to the best of its ability until it completes the task, then waits for\
    \ your next command.\nIf you command the servant to perform a task that would\
    \ move it more than 60 feet away from you, the spell ends."
