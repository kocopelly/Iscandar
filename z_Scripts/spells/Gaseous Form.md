description: "You transform a willing creature you touch, along with everything it\u2019\
    s wearing and carrying, into a misty cloud for the duration. The spell ends if\
    \ the creature drops to 0 hit points. An incorporeal creature isn\u2019t affected.\n\
    While in this form, the target\u2019s only method of movement is a flying speed\
    \ of 10 feet. The target can enter and occupy the space of another creature. The\
    \ target has resistance to nonmagical damage, and it has advantage on Strength,\
    \ Dexterity, and Constitution saving throws. The target can pass through small\
    \ holes, narrow openings, and even mere cracks, though it treats liquids as though\
    \ they were solid surfaces. The target can\u2019t fall and remains hovering in\
    \ the air even when stunned or otherwise incapacitated.\nWhile in the form of\
    \ a misty cloud, the target can\u2019t talk or manipulate objects, and any objects\
    \ it was carrying or holding can\u2019t be dropped, used, or otherwise interacted\
    \ with. The target can\u2019t attack or cast spells."
