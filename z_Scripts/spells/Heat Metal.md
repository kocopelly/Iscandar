description: "Choose a manufactured metal object, such as a metal weapon or a suit\
    \ of heavy or medium metal armor, that you can see within range. You cause the\
    \ object to glow red-hot. Any creature in physical contact with the object takes\
    \ 2d8 fire damage when you cast the spell. Until the spell ends, you can use a\
    \ bonus action on each of your subsequent turns to cause this damage again.\n\
    If a creature is holding or wearing the object and takes the damage from it, the\
    \ creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or drop the object if it\
    \ can. If it doesn\u2019t drop the object, it has disadvantage on attack rolls\
    \ and ability checks until the start of your next turn.\n**At Higher Levels.**\
    \ When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage\
    \ increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 2nd."
