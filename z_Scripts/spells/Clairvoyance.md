description: "You create an invisible sensor within range in a location familiar to\

    \ is unfamiliar to you (such as behind a door, around a corner, or in a grove\
    \ of trees). The sensor remains in place for the duration, and it can\u2019t be\
    \ attacked or otherwise interacted with.\nWhen you cast the spell, you choose\
    \ seeing or hearing. You can use the chosen sense through the sensor as if you\
    \ were in its space. As your action, you can switch between seeing and hearing.\n\
    A creature that can see the sensor (such as a creature benefiting from **see invisibility**\
    \ or truesight) sees a luminous, intangible orb about the size of your fist."
