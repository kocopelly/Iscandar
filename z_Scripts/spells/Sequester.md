description: "By means of this spell, a willing creature or an object can be hidden\
    \ away, safe from detection for the duration. When you cast the spell and touch\
    \ the target, it becomes invisible and can\u2019t be targeted by divination spells\
    \ or perceived through scrying sensors created by divination spells.\nIf the target\
    \ is a creature, it falls into a state of suspended animation. Time ceases to\
    \ flow for it, and it doesn\u2019t grow older.\nYou can set a condition for the\
    \ spell to end early. The condition can be anything you choose, but it must occur\
    \ or be visible within 1 mile of the target. Examples include \u201Cafter 1,000\
    \ years\u201D or \u201Cwhen the tarrasque awakens.\u201D This spell also ends\
    \ if the target takes any damage."
