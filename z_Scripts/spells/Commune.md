description: "You contact your deity or a divine proxy and ask up to three questions\
    \ that can be answered with a yes or no. You must ask your questions before the\
    \ spell ends. You receive a correct answer for each question.\nDivine beings aren\u2019\
    t necessarily omniscient, so you might receive \u201Cunclear\u201D as an answer\
    \ if a question pertains to information that lies beyond the deity\u2019s knowledge.\
    \ In a case where a one-word answer could be misleading or contrary to the deity\u2019\
    s interests, the GM might offer a short phrase as an answer instead.\nIf you cast\
    \ the spell two or more times before finishing your next long rest, there is a\
    \ cumulative 25 percent chance for each casting after the first that you get no\
    \ answer. The GM makes this roll in secret."
