description: "You create a seismic disturbance at a point on the ground that you can\
    \ see within range. For the duration, an intense tremor rips through the ground\
    \ in a 100-foot-radius circle centered on that point and shakes creatures and\
    \ structures in contact with the ground in that area.\nThe ground in the area\
    \ becomes difficult terrain.\nEach creature on the ground that is concentrating\
    \ must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature\u2019\
    s concentration is broken.\nWhen you cast this spell and at the end of each turn\
    \ you spend concentrating on it, each creature on the ground in the area must\
    \ make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is knocked prone.\n\
    This spell can have additional effects depending on the terrain in the area, as\
    \ determined by the GM. **Fissures.** Fissures open throughout the spell\u2019\
    s area at the start of your next turn after you cast the spell. A total of 1d6\
    \ such fissures open in locations chosen by the GM. Each is 1d10 \xD7 10 feet\
    \ deep, 10 feet wide, and extends from one edge of the spell\u2019s area to the\
    \ opposite side. A creature standing on a spot where a fissure opens must succeed\
    \ on a Dexterity saving throw or fall in. A creature that successfully saves moves\
    \ with the fissure\u2019s edge as it opens.\nA fissure that opens beneath a structure\
    \ causes it to automatically collapse (see below).\n**Structures.** The tremor\
    \ deals 50 bludgeoning damage to any structure in contact with the ground in the\
    \ area when you cast the spell and at the start of each of your turns until the\
    \ spell ends. If a structure drops to 0 hit points, it collapses and potentially\
    \ damages nearby creatures. A creature within half the distance of a structure\u2019\
    s height must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes\
    \ 5d6 bludgeoning damage, is knocked prone, and is buried in the rubble, requiring\
    \ a DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check as an action to escape. The GM can adjust\
    \ the DC higher or lower, depending on the nature of the rubble. On a successful\
    \ save, the creature takes half as much damage and doesn\u2019t fall prone or\
    \ become buried."
