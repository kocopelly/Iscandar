description: "A 5-foot-diameter sphere of fire appears in an unoccupied space of your\
    \ choice within range and lasts for the duration. Any creature that ends its turn\
    \ within 5 feet of the sphere must make a Dexterity saving throw. The creature\
    \ takes 2d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful\
    \ one.\nAs a bonus action, you can move the sphere up to 30 feet. If you ram the\
    \ sphere into a creature, that creature must make the saving throw against the\
    \ sphere\u2019s damage, and the sphere stops moving this turn.\nWhen you move\
    \ the sphere, you can direct it over barriers up to 5 feet tall and jump it across\
    \ pits up to 10 feet wide. The sphere ignites flammable objects not being worn\
    \ or carried, and it sheds bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for\
    \ an additional 20 feet.\n**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using\
    \ a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot\
    \ level above 2nd."
