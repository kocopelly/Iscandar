description: "You create a Large hand of shimmering, translucent force in an unoccupied\
    \ space that you can see within range. The hand lasts for the spell\u2019s duration,\
    \ and it moves at your command, mimicking the movements of your own hand.\nThe\
    \ hand is an object that has AC 20 and hit points equal to your hit point maximum.\
    \ If it drops to 0 hit points, the spell ends. It has a Strength of 26 (+8) and\
    \ a Dexterity of 10 (+0). The hand doesn\u2019t fill its space.\nWhen you cast\
    \ the spell and as a bonus action on your subsequent turns, you can move the hand\
    \ up to 60 feet and then cause one of the following effects with it.\n**Clenched\
    \ Fist.** The hand strikes one creature or object within 5 feet of it. Make a\
    \ melee spell attack for the hand using your game statistics. On a hit, the target\
    \ takes 4d8 force damage.\n**Forceful Hand.** The hand attempts to push a creature\
    \ within 5 feet of it in a direction you choose.\nMake a check with the hand\u2019\
    s Strength contested by the Strength (Athletics) check of the target. If the target\
    \ is Medium or smaller, you have advantage on the check. If you succeed, the hand\
    \ pushes the target up to 5 feet plus a number of feet equal to five times your\
    \ spellcasting ability modifier. The hand moves with the target to remain within\
    \ 5 feet of it.\n**Grasping Hand.** The hand attempts to grapple a Huge or smaller\
    \ creature within 5 feet of it. You use the hand\u2019s Strength score to resolve\
    \ the grapple. If the target is Medium or smaller, you have advantage on the check.\
    \ While the hand is grappling the target, you can use a bonus action to have the\
    \ hand crush it. When you do so, the target takes bludgeoning damage equal to\
    \ 2d6 + your spellcasting ability modifier.\n**Interposing Hand.** The hand interposes\
    \ itself between you and a creature you choose until you give the hand a different\
    \ command. The hand moves to stay between you and the target, providing you with\
    \ half cover against the target. The target can\u2019t move through the hand\u2019\
    s space if its Strength score is less than or equal to the hand\u2019s Strength\
    \ score. If its Strength score is higher than the hand\u2019s Strength score,\
    \ the target can move toward you through the hand\u2019s space, but that space\
    \ is difficult terrain for the target.\n**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this\
    \ spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the damage from the clenched\
    \ fist option increases by 2d8 and the damage from the grasping hand increases\
    \ by 2d6 for each slot level above 5th."
