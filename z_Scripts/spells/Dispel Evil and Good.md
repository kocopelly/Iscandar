    \ fey, fiends, and undead have disadvantage on attack rolls against you.\nYou\
    \ can end the spell early by using either of the following special functions.\n\
    **Break Enchantment.** As your action, you touch a creature you can reach that\
    \ is charmed, frightened, or possessed by a celestial, an elemental, a fey, a\
    \ fiend, or an undead. The creature you touch is no longer charmed, frightened,\
    \ or possessed by such creatures.\n**Dismissal.** As your action, make a melee\
    \ spell attack against a celestial, an elemental, a fey, a fiend, or an undead\
    \ you can reach. On a hit, you attempt to drive the creature back to its home\
    \ plane. The creature must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or be sent back\
    \ to its home plane (if it isn\u2019t there already). If they aren\u2019t on their\
    \ home plane, undead are sent to the Shadowfell, and fey are sent to the Feywild."
