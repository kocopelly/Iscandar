description: "You touch a dead humanoid or a piece of a dead humanoid. Provided that\
    \ the creature has been dead no longer than 10 days, the spell forms a new adult\
    \ body for it and then calls the soul to enter that body.\nIf the target\u2019\
    s soul isn\u2019t free or willing to do so, the spell fails.\nThe magic fashions\
    \ a new body for the creature to inhabit, which likely causes the creature\u2019\
    s race to change. The GM rolls a d100 and consults the following table to determine\
    \ what form the creature takes when restored to life, or the GM chooses a form.\n\
    **01\u201304:** Dragonborn\n**05\u201313:** Dwarf, hill\n**14\u201321:** Dwarf,\
    \ mountain\n**22\u201325:** Elf, dark\n**26\u201334:** Elf, high\n**35\u201342:**\
    \ Elf, wood\n**43\u201346:** Gnome, forest\n**47\u201352:** Gnome, rock\n**53\u2013\
    56:** Half-elf\n**57\u201360:** Half-orc\n**61\u201368:** Halfling, lightfoot\n\
    **69\u201376:** Halfling, stout\n**77\u201396:** Human\n**97\u201300:** Tiefling\n\
    The reincarnated creature recalls its former life and experiences. It retains\
    \ the capabilities it had in its original form, except it exchanges its original\
    \ race for the new one and changes its racial traits accordingly."
