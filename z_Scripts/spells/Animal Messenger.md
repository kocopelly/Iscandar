description: "By means of this spell, you use an animal to deliver a message. Choose\
    \ a Tiny beast you can see within range, such as a squirrel, a blue jay, or a\
    \ bat. You specify a location, which you must have visited, and a recipient who\
    \ matches a general description, such as \u201Ca man or woman dressed in the uniform\
    \ of the town guard\u201D or \u201Ca red-haired dwarf wearing a pointed hat.\u201D\
    \ You also speak a message of up to twenty-five words. The target beast travels\
    \ for the duration of the spell toward the specified location, covering about\
    \ 50 miles per 24 hours for a flying messenger, or 25 miles for other animals.\n\
    When the messenger arrives, it delivers your message to the creature that you\
    \ described, replicating the sound of your voice. The messenger speaks only to\
    \ a creature matching the description you gave. If the messenger doesn\u2019t\
    \ reach its destination before the spell ends, the message is lost, and the beast\
    \ makes its way back to where you cast this spell.\n**At Higher Levels.** If you\
    \ cast this spell using a spell slot of 3nd level or higher, the duration of the\
    \ spell increases by 48 hours for each slot level above 2nd."
