description: "Roll a d20 at the end of each of your turns for the duration of the\
    \ spell. On a roll of 11 or higher, you vanish from your current plane of existence\
    \ and appear in the Ethereal Plane (the spell fails and the casting is wasted\
    \ if you were already on that plane). At the start of your next turn, and when\
    \ the spell ends if you are on the Ethereal Plane, you return to an unoccupied\
    \ space of your choice that you can see within 10 feet of the space you vanished\
    \ from. If no unoccupied space is available within that range, you appear in the\
    \ nearest unoccupied space (chosen at random if more than one space is equally\
    \ near). You can dismiss this spell as an action.\nWhile on the Ethereal Plane,\
    \ you can see and hear the plane you originated from, which is cast in shades\
    \ of gray, and you can\u2019t see anything there more than 60 feet away. You can\
    \ only affect and be affected by other creatures on the Ethereal Plane. Creatures\
    \ that aren\u2019t there can\u2019t perceive you or interact with you, unless\
    \ they have the ability to do so."
