description: "You teleport yourself from your current location to any other spot within\
    \ range. You arrive at exactly the spot desired. It can be a place you can see,\
    \ one you can visualize, or one you can describe by stating distance and direction,\
    \ such as \u201C200 feet straight downward\u201D or \u201Cupward to the northwest\
    \ at a 45- degree angle, 300 feet.\u201D\nYou can bring along objects as long\
    \ as their weight doesn\u2019t exceed what you can carry. You can also bring one\
    \ willing creature of your size or smaller who is carrying gear up to its carrying\
    \ capacity. The creature must be within 5 feet of you when you cast this spell.\n\
    If you would arrive in a place already occupied by an object or a creature, you\
    \ and any creature traveling with you each take 4d6 force damage, and the spell\
    \ fails to teleport you."
