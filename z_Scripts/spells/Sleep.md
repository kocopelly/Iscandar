description: "This spell sends creatures into a magical slumber. Roll 5d8; the total\
    \ is how many hit points of creatures this spell can affect. Creatures within\
    \ 20 feet of a point you choose within range are affected in ascending order of\
    \ their current hit points (ignoring unconscious creatures).\nStarting with the\
    \ creature that has the lowest current hit points, each creature affected by this\
    \ spell falls unconscious until the spell ends, the sleeper takes damage, or someone\
    \ uses an action to shake or slap the sleeper awake. Subtract each creature\u2019\
    s hit points from the total before moving on to the creature with the next lowest\
    \ hit points. A creature\u2019s hit points must be equal to or less than the remaining\
    \ total for that creature to be affected.\nUndead and creatures immune to being\
    \ charmed aren\u2019t affected by this spell.\n**At Higher Levels.** When you\
    \ cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, roll an additional\
    \ 2d8 for each slot level above 1st."
