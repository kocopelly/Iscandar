description: "Describe or name a creature that is familiar to you. You sense the direction\
    \ to the creature\u2019s location, as long as that creature is within 1,000 feet\
    \ of you. If the creature is moving, you know the direction of its movement.\n\
    The spell can locate a specific creature known to you, or the nearest creature\
    \ of a specific kind (such as a human or a unicorn), so long as you have seen\
    \ such a creature up close\u2014within 30 feet\u2014at least once. If the creature\
    \ you described or named is in a different form, such as being under the effects\
    \ of a **polymorph** spell, this spell doesn\u2019t locate the creature.\nThis\
    \ spell can\u2019t locate a creature if running water at least 10 feet wide blocks\
    \ a direct path between you and the creature."
