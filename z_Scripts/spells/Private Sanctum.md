description: "You make an area within range magically secure. The area is a cube that\
    \ can be as small as 5 feet to as large as 100 feet on each side. The spell lasts\
    \ for the duration or until you use an action to dismiss it.\nWhen you cast the\
    \ spell, you decide what sort of security the spell provides, choosing any or\
    \ all of the following properties:\n** Sound can\u2019t pass through the barrier\
    \ at the edge of the warded area.\n** The barrier of the warded area appears dark\
    \ and foggy, preventing vision (including darkvision) through it.\n** Sensors\
    \ created by divination spells can\u2019t appear inside the protected area or\
    \ pass through the barrier at its perimeter.\n** Creatures in the area can\u2019\
    t be targeted by divination spells.\n** Nothing can teleport into or out of the\
    \ warded area.\n** Planar travel is blocked within the warded area. Casting this\
    \ spell on the same spot every day for a year makes this effect permanent.\n**At\
    \ Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or\
    \ higher, you can increase the size of the cube by 100 feet for each slot level\
    \ beyond 4th. Thus you could protect a cube that can be up to 200 feet on one\
    \ side by using a spell slot of 5th level."
