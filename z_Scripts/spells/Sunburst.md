description: "Brilliant sunlight flashes in a 60-foot radius centered on a point you\
    \ choose within range. Each creature in that light must make a Constitution saving\
    \ throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 12d6 radiant damage and is blinded\
    \ for 1 minute. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage and isn\u2019\
    t blinded by this spell. Undead and oozes have disadvantage on this saving throw.\n\
    A creature blinded by this spell makes another Constitution saving throw at the\
    \ end of each of its turns. On a successful save, it is no longer blinded.\nThis\
    \ spell dispels any darkness in its area that was created by a spell."
