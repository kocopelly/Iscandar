description: "You alter time around up to six creatures of your choice in a 40-foot\
    \ cube within range. Each target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be affected\
    \ by this spell for the duration.\nAn affected target\u2019s speed is halved,\
    \ it takes a \u22122 penalty to AC and Dexterity saving throws, and it can\u2019\
    t use reactions. On its turn, it can use either an action or a bonus action, not\
    \ both. Regardless of the creature\u2019s abilities or magic items, it can\u2019\
    t make more than one melee or ranged attack during its turn.\nIf the creature\
    \ attempts to cast a spell with a casting time of 1 action, roll a d20. On an\
    \ 11 or higher, the spell doesn\u2019t take effect until the creature\u2019s next\
    \ turn, and the creature must use its action on that turn to complete the spell.\
    \ If it can\u2019t, the spell is wasted.\nA creature affected by this spell makes\
    \ another Wisdom saving throw at the end of its turn. On a successful save, the\
    \ effect ends for it."
