description: "You create the image of an object, a creature, or some other visible\
    \ phenomenon that is no larger than a 15-foot cube. The image appears at a spot\
    \ within range and lasts for the duration. The image is purely visual; it isn\u2019\
    t accompanied by sound, smell, or other sensory effects.\nYou can use your action\
    \ to cause the image to move to any spot within range. As the image changes location,\
    \ you can alter its appearance so that its movements appear natural for the image.\
    \ For example, if you create an image of a creature and move it, you can alter\
    \ the image so that it appears to be walking.\nPhysical interaction with the image\
    \ reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it. A creature\
    \ that uses its action to examine the image can determine that it is an illusion\
    \ with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save\
    \ DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see\
    \ through the image."
