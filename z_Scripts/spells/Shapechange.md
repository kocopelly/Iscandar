description: "You assume the form of a different creature for the duration. The new\
    \ form can be of any creature with a challenge rating equal to your level or lower.\
    \ The creature can\u2019t be a construct or an undead, and you must have seen\
    \ the sort of creature at least once. You transform into an average example of\
    \ that creature, one without any class levels or the Spellcasting trait.\nYour\
    \ game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the chosen creature, though\
    \ you retain your alignment and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You\
    \ also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to\
    \ gaining those of the creature. If the creature has the same proficiency as you\
    \ and the bonus listed in its statistics is higher than yours, use the creature\u2019\
    s bonus in place of yours. You can\u2019t use any legendary actions or lair actions\
    \ of the new form.\nYou assume the hit points and Hit Dice of the new form. When\
    \ you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had\
    \ before you transformed. If you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points,\
    \ any excess damage carries over to your normal form. As long as the excess damage\
    \ doesn\u2019t reduce your normal form to 0 hit points, you aren\u2019t knocked\
    \ unconscious.\nYou retain the benefit of any features from your class, race,\
    \ or other source and can use them, provided that your new form is physically\
    \ capable of doing so. You can\u2019t use any special senses you have (for example,\
    \ darkvision) unless your new form also has that sense. You can only speak if\
    \ the creature can normally speak.\nWhen you transform, you choose whether your\
    \ equipment falls to the ground, merges into the new form, or is worn by it. Worn\
    \ equipment functions as normal. The GM determines whether it is practical for\
    \ the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature\u2019s shape\
    \ and size. Your equipment doesn\u2019t change shape or size to match the new\
    \ form, and any equipment that the new form can\u2019t wear must either fall to\
    \ the ground or merge into your new form. Equipment that merges has no effect\
    \ in that state.\nDuring this spell\u2019s duration, you can use your action to\
    \ assume a different form following the same restrictions and rules for the original\
    \ form, with one exception: if your new form has more hit points than your current\
    \ one, your hit points remain at their current value."
