description: "By casting gem-inlaid sticks, rolling dragon bones, laying out ornate\
    \ cards, or employing some other divining tool, you receive an omen from an otherworldly\
    \ entity about the results of a specific course of action that you plan to take\
    \ within the next 30 minutes. The GM chooses from the following possible omens:\n\
    ** **Weal**, for good results\n** **Woe**, for bad results\n** **Weal and woe**,\
    \ for both good and bad results\n** **Nothing**, for results that aren\u2019t\
    \ especially good or bad\nThe spell doesn\u2019t take into account any possible\
    \ circumstances that might change the outcome, such as the casting of additional\
    \ spells or the loss or gain of a companion.\nIf you cast the spell two or more\
    \ times before completing your next long rest, there is a cumulative 25 percent\
    \ chance for each casting after the first that you get a random reading. The GM\
    \ makes this roll in secret."
