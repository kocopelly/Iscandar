description: "You imbue plants within 30 feet of you with limited sentience and animation,\
    \ giving them the ability to communicate with you and follow your simple commands.\
    \ You can question plants about events in the spell\u2019s area within the past\
    \ day, gaining information about creatures that have passed, weather, and other\
    \ circumstances.\nYou can also turn difficult terrain caused by plant growth (such\
    \ as thickets and undergrowth) into ordinary terrain that lasts for the duration.\
    \ Or you can turn ordinary terrain where plants are present into difficult terrain\
    \ that lasts for the duration, causing vines and branches to hinder pursuers,\
    \ for example.\nPlants might be able to perform other tasks on your behalf, at\
    \ the GM\u2019s discretion. The spell doesn\u2019t enable plants to uproot themselves\
    \ and move about, but they can freely move branches, tendrils, and stalks.\nIf\
    \ a plant creature is in the area, you can communicate with it as if you shared\
    \ a common language, but you gain no magical ability to influence it.\nThis spell\
    \ can cause the plants created by the **entangle** spell to release a restrained\
    \ creature."
