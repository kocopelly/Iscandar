description: "You suggest a course of activity (limited to a sentence or two) and\
    \ magically influence up to twelve creatures of your choice that you can see within\
    \ range and that can hear and understand you. Creatures that can\u2019t be charmed\
    \ are immune to this effect. The suggestion must be worded in such a manner as\
    \ to make the course of action sound reasonable. Asking the creature to stab itself,\
    \ throw itself onto a spear, immolate itself, or do some other obviously harmful\
    \ act automatically negates the effect of the spell.\nEach target must make a\
    \ Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it pursues the course of action you described\
    \ to the best of its ability. The suggested course of action can continue for\
    \ the entire duration. If the suggested activity can be completed in a shorter\
    \ time, the spell ends when the subject finishes what it was asked to do.\nYou\
    \ can also specify conditions that will trigger a special activity during the\
    \ duration. For example, you might suggest that a group of soldiers give all their\
    \ money to the first beggar they meet. If the condition isn\u2019t met before\
    \ the spell ends, the activity isn\u2019t performed.\nIf you or any of your companions\
    \ damage a creature affected by this spell, the spell ends for that creature.\n\
    **At Higher Levels**. When you cast this spell using a 7th-level spell slot, the\
    \ duration is 10 days. When you use an 8th-level spell slot, the duration is 30\
    \ days. When you use a 9th-level spell slot, the duration is a year and a day."
