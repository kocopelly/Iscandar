description: "This spell reverses gravity in a 50-foot-radius, 100- foot high cylinder\
    \ centered on a point within range. All creatures and objects that aren\u2019\
    t somehow anchored to the ground in the area fall upward and reach the top of\
    \ the area when you cast this spell. A creature can make a Dexterity saving throw\
    \ to grab onto a fixed object it can reach, thus avoiding the fall.\nIf some solid\
    \ object (such as a ceiling) is encountered in this fall, falling objects and\
    \ creatures strike it just as they would during a normal downward fall. If an\
    \ object or creature reaches the top of the area without striking anything, it\
    \ remains there, oscillating slightly, for the duration.\nAt the end of the duration,\
    \ affected objects and creatures fall back down."
