description: "You summon fey spirits that take the form of beasts and appear in unoccupied\
    \ spaces that you can see within range. Choose one of the following options for\
    \ what appears:\n** One beast of challenge rating 2 or lower\n** Two beasts of\
    \ challenge rating 1 or lower\n** Four beasts of challenge rating 1/2 or lower\n\
    ** Eight beasts of challenge rating 1/4 or lower Each beast is also considered\
    \ fey, and it disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends.\n\
    The summoned creatures are friendly to you and your companions. Roll initiative\
    \ for the summoned creatures as a group, which has its own turns. They obey any\
    \ verbal commands that you issue to them (no action required by you). If you don\u2019\
    t issue any commands to them, they defend themselves from hostile creatures, but\
    \ otherwise take no actions.\nThe GM has the creatures\u2019 statistics.\n**At\
    \ Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using certain higher-level spell slots,\
    \ you choose one of the summoning options above, and more creatures appear: twice\
    \ as many with a 5th-level slot, three times as many with a 7th-level slot, and\
    \ four times as many with a 9th-level slot."
