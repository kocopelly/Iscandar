description: "You unleash a virulent disease on a creature that you can see within\
    \ range. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it\
    \ takes 14d6 necrotic damage, or half as much damage on a successful save. The\
    \ damage can\u2019t reduce the target\u2019s hit points below 1. If the target\
    \ fails the saving throw, its hit point maximum is reduced for 1 hour by an amount\
    \ equal to the necrotic damage it took. Any effect that removes a disease allows\
    \ a creature\u2019s hit point maximum to return to normal before that time passes."
