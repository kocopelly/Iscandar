description: "You create a sound or an image of an object within range that lasts\
    \ for the duration. The illusion also ends if you dismiss it as an action or cast\
    \ this spell again.\nIf you create a sound, its volume can range from a whisper\
    \ to a scream. It can be your voice, someone else\u2019s voice, a lion\u2019s\
    \ roar, a beating of drums, or any other sound you choose. The sound continues\
    \ unabated throughout the duration, or you can make discrete sounds at different\
    \ times before the spell ends.\nIf you create an image of an object\u2014such\
    \ as a chair, muddy footprints, or a small chest\u2014it must be no larger than\
    \ a 5-foot cube. The image can\u2019t create sound, light, smell, or any other\
    \ sensory effect. Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion,\
    \ because things can pass through it.\nIf a creature uses its action to examine\
    \ the sound or image, the creature can determine that it is an illusion with a\
    \ successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If\
    \ a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the illusion becomes faint\
    \ to the creature."
