description: "A sudden loud ringing noise, painfully intense, erupts from a point\
    \ of your choice within range. Each creature in a 10-foot-radius sphere centered\
    \ on that point must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature takes 3d8 thunder\
    \ damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature\
    \ made of inorganic material such as stone, crystal, or metal has disadvantage\
    \ on this saving throw.\nA nonmagical object that isn\u2019t being worn or carried\
    \ also takes the damage if it\u2019s in the spell\u2019s area.\n**At Higher Levels.**\
    \ When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage\
    \ increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 2nd."
