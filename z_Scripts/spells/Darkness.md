description: "Magical darkness spreads from a point you choose within range to fill\
    \ a 15-foot-radius sphere for the duration. The darkness spreads around corners.\
    \ A creature with darkvision can\u2019t see through this darkness, and nonmagical\
    \ light can\u2019t illuminate it.\nIf the point you choose is on an object you\
    \ are holding or one that isn\u2019t being worn or carried, the darkness emanates\
    \ from the object and moves with it. Completely covering the source of the darkness\
    \ with an opaque object, such as a bowl or a helm, blocks the darkness.\nIf any\
    \ of this spell\u2019s area overlaps with an area of light created by a spell\
    \ of 2nd level or lower, the spell that created the light is dispelled."
