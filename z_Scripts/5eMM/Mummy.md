-   desc: " Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 10 (2d6\
        \ + 3) bludgeoning damage plus 10 (3d6) necrotic damage. If the target is\
        \ a creature, it must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or be cursed\
        \ with mummy rot. The cursed target can\u2019t regain hit points, and its\
        \ hit point maximum decreases by 10 (3d6) for every 24 hours that elapse.\

        \ dies, and its body turns to dust. The curse lasts until removed by the remove\
        \ curse spell or other magic."

        s next turn. If the target fails the saving throw by 5 or more, it is also\
        \ paralyzed for the same duration. A target that succeeds on the saving throw\
        \ is immune to the Dreadful Glare of all mummies (but not mummy lords) for\
        \ the next 24 hours."
