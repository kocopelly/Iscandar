-   desc: " If the bulette jumps at least 15 feet as part of its movement, it can\
        \ then use this action to land on its feet in a space that contains one or\
        \ more other creatures. Each of those creatures must succeed on a DC 16 Strength\
        \ or Dexterity saving throw (target\u2019s choice) or be knocked prone and\
        \ take 14 (3d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage plus 14 (3d6 + 4) slashing damage.\
        \ On a successful save, the creature takes only half the damage, isn\u2019\
        t knocked prone, and is pushed 5 feet out of the bulette\u2019s space into\
        \ an unoccupied space of the creature\u2019s choice. If no unoccupied space\
        \ is within range, the creature instead falls prone in the bulette\u2019s\
        \ space."
