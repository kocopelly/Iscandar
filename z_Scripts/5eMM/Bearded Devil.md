    name: Multiattack.
-   desc: " Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 6 (1d8\
        \ + 2) piercing damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution\
        \ saving throw or be poisoned for 1 minute. While poisoned in this way, the\
        \ target can\u2019t regain hit points. The target can repeat the saving throw\
        \ at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success."
    name: Beard.
-   desc: ' Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 8 (1d10
        + 3) slashing damage. If the target is a creature other than an undead or
        a construct, it must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or lose
        5 (1d10) hit points at the start of each of its turns due to an infernal wound.
        Each time the devil hits the wounded target with this attack, the damage dealt
        by the wound increases by 5 (1d10). Any creature can take an action to stanch
        the wound with a successful DC 12 Wisdom (Medicine) check. The wound also
        closes if the target receives magical healing.'
