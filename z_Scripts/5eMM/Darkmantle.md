-   desc: " Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 6 (1d6\
        \ + 3) bludgeoning damage, and the darkmantle attaches to the target. If the\
        \ target is Medium or smaller and the darkmantle has advantage on the attack\
        \ roll, it attaches by engulfing the target\u2019s head, and the target is\
        \ also blinded and unable to breathe while the darkmantle is attached in this\
        \ way."
    name: Crush.
-   desc: " A 15-foot radius of magical darkness extends out from the darkmantle,\
        \ moves with it, and spreads around corners. The darkness lasts as long as\
        \ the darkmantle maintains concentration, up to 10 minutes (as if concentrating\
        \ on a spell). Darkvision can\u2019t penetrate this darkness, and no natural\
        \ light can illuminate it. If any of the darkness overlaps with an area of\
        \ light created by a spell of 2nd level or lower, the spell creating the light\
        \ is dispelled."
