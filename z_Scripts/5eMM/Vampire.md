-   desc: ' The vampire makes two attacks, only one of which can be a bite attack.'
    name: Multiattack (Vampire Form Only).
-   desc: ' Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 8 (1d8
        + 4) bludgeoning damage. Instead of dealing damage, the vampire can grapple
        the target (escape DC 18).'
    name: Unarmed Strike (Vampire Form Only).
-   desc: " Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one willing creature, or\
        \ a creature that is grappled by the vampire, incapacitated, or restrained.\
        \ Hit: 7 (1d6 + 4) piercing damage plus 10 (3d6) necrotic damage. The target\u2019\
        s hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage taken,\
        \ and the vampire regains hit points equal to that amount. The reduction lasts\
        \ until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces\
        \ its hit point maximum to 0. A humanoid slain in this way and then buried\
        \ in the ground rises the following night as a vampire spawn under the vampire\u2019\
        s control."
    name: Bite (Bat or Vampire Form Only).
-   desc: " The vampire targets one humanoid it can see within 30 feet of it. If the\
        \ target can see the vampire, the target must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving\
        \ throw against this magic or be charmed by the vampire. The charmed target\
        \ regards the vampire as a trusted friend to be heeded and protected. Although\
        \ the target isn\u2019t under the vampire\u2019s control, it takes the vampire\u2019\
        s requests or actions in the most favorable way it can, and it is a willing\
        \ target for the vampire\u2019s bite attack."
    name: Charm.
-   desc: " The vampire magically calls 2d4 swarms of bats or rats, provided that\
        \ the sun isn\u2019t up. While outdoors, the vampire can call 3d6 wolves instead.\
        \ The called creatures arrive in 1d4 rounds, acting as allies of the vampire\
        \ and obeying its spoken commands. The beasts remain for 1 hour, until the\
        \ vampire dies, or until the vampire dismisses them as a bonus action."
