-   desc: " The ghost enters the Ethereal Plane from the Material Plane, or vice versa.\
        \ It is visible on the Material Plane while it is in the Border Ethereal,\
        \ and vice versa, yet it can\u2019t affect or be affected by anything on the\
        \ other plane."
    name: Etherealness.
-   desc: " Each non-undead creature within 60 feet of the ghost that can see it must\
        \ succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute. If\
        \ the save fails by 5 or more, the target also ages 1d4 \xD7 10 years. A frightened\
        \ target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending\
        \ the frightened condition on itself on a success. If a target\u2019s saving\
        \ throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the target is immune to this\
        \ ghost\u2019s Horrifying Visage for the next 24 hours. The aging effect can\
        \ be reversed with a greater restoration spell, but only within 24 hours of\
        \ it occurring."
    name: Horrifying Visage.
-   desc: " One humanoid that the ghost can see within 5 feet of it must succeed on\
        \ a DC 13 Charisma saving throw or be possessed by the ghost; the ghost then\
        \ disappears, and the target is incapacitated and loses control of its body.\
        \ The ghost now controls the body but doesn\u2019t deprive the target of awareness.\
        \ The ghost can\u2019t be targeted by any attack, spell, or other effect,\
        \ except ones that turn undead, and it retains its alignment, Intelligence,\
        \ Wisdom, Charisma, and immunity to being charmed and frightened. It otherwise\
        \ uses the possessed target\u2019s statistics, but doesn\u2019t gain access\
        \ to the target\u2019s knowledge, class features, or proficiencies."
