-   desc: ' A 15-foot-radius cloud of toxic spores extends out from the vrock. The
        spores spread around corners. Each creature in that area must succeed on a
        DC 14 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned. While poisoned in this
        way, a target takes 5 (1d10) poison damage at the start of each of its turns.
        A target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending
        the effect on itself on a success. Emptying a vial of holy water on the target
        also ends the effect on it.'
