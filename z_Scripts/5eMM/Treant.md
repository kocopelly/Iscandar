-   desc: " The treant magically animates one or two trees it can see within 60 feet\
        \ of it. These trees have the same statistics as a treant, except they have\
        \ Intelligence and Charisma scores of 1, they can\u2019t speak, and they have\
        \ only the Slam action option. An animated tree acts as an ally of the treant.\
        \ The tree remains animate for 1 day or until it dies; until the treant dies\
        \ or is more than 120 feet from the tree; or until the treant takes a bonus\
        \ action to turn it back into an inanimate tree. The tree then takes root\
        \ if possible."
