3) After closing codeblock, a descriptive prompt to be fed into an AI image generator. Use nouns and adjectives to describe the image to be generated, with reference to style, composition, and colors. Never use any terms from the fantasy world since the AI doesn't know them. Example below A digital illustration in the style of concept artist Eyvind Earle, depicting a city nestled in the foothills of a vast forest with homes built around and within the trees. Humans, elves, and forest gnomes, and a color palette of greens, browns, and earthy tones to evoke the sense of a tranquil, nature-centric city.
