# Council of Tides

The Council of Tides is the governing body of the Tidewhisper Shores, a region deeply influenced by Aquarion, the deity of water. As a symbol of their devotion and respect for Aquarion, the Council holds its meetings on floating platforms or specially designed underwater chambers. Each council member possesses a ceremonial conch shell, intricately carved and often passed down through generations, used to signal the start of meetings, call for order, or announce important decisions.

## Waterborne Council Meetings

Council meetings are conducted on floating platforms or in specially designed underwater chambers, demonstrating the Council's reverence for Aquarion and their commitment to maintaining harmony with the water element. These meetings are a blend of practical governance and spiritual devotion, with the rhythmic lapping of waves or the tranquil silence of the underwater world serving as a constant reminder of Aquarion's influence.

## Ceremonial Conch Shells

Each council member is entrusted with a ceremonial conch shell, an item of significant cultural and spiritual importance. These shells are intricately carved and often passed down through generations, each carrying the history and wisdom of its previous bearers. The conch shell is used to signal the start of council meetings, call for order, or announce important decisions, its resonant call echoing the voice of the sea.

## Tide-touched Advisors

The Council of Tides includes a select group of individuals known as "Tide-touched," believed to have been blessed by Aquarion with unique insights and prophetic abilities. These advisors provide spiritual guidance and help shape the council's decisions. Their counsel often comes in the form of cryptic messages and visions, which are interpreted by the council members to guide their governance of the Tidewhisper Shores.
