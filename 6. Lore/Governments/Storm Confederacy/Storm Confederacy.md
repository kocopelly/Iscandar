# Storm Confederacy

The Storm Confederacy is a confederacy of cities in the Stormhaven Plateau, built on the principle of balance and representation among the four elemental factions â€“ air, earth, fire, and water. Its ruling council is composed of representatives from each of the member cities, each with ties to one of the elemental factions. Each faction's unique attire, symbols, and traditions are prominently displayed during council meetings and public events, as a tribute to the diversity and unity of the Confederacy.

## Elemental Council

The Elemental Council is the central decision-making body of the Storm Confederacy. Composed of representatives from each of the member cities, each council member embodies the unique strengths, wisdom, and perspectives of their associated elemental faction. This council convenes to discuss and resolve issues affecting the Confederacy and the Plateau, always striving for a balance among the elements.

## Trial by Elements

When a significant decision needs to be made, the Storm Confederacy may call for a "Trial by Elements." In this unique process, each elemental faction presents its case and champions engage in a ceremonial contest that represents their faction's strength and wisdom. The outcome of the trial often guides the final decision of the council, reinforcing the value the Confederacy places on the voice of each element.

## Elemental Ambassadors

The Storm Confederacy encourages an exchange of "Elemental Ambassadors" among its member cities, as a measure to promote harmony and understanding between the different elemental factions. These ambassadors live and work in other cities for a set period of time, sharing their unique elemental knowledge and learning from the host city. This program not only enriches the understanding of each faction but fosters a spirit of unity and cooperation among the cities of the Storm Confederacy.
