# Emberhold Mining Consortium

The Emberhold Mining Consortium is a group of wealthy mine owners who collectively control the majority of the Expanse's mineral resources. They are based in [[Emberhold]] and have a substantial influence over the region's economy.

## Influence and Goals

The Consortium is a dominant power in Emberhold. Through their control over the mines and the vast wealth they generate, they have a significant impact on the region's economic and political landscape. They seek to maintain their economic dominance and are prepared to use any means necessary to protect their interests.

With the wealth amassed from their mining operations, the Consortium has been building a private army of mercenaries. They view the chaos in the Expanse following Pyrothar's disappearance as an opportunity to expand their control and influence.

## Resources and Abilities

The Consortium controls the majority of the mineral resources in the Expanse, including several rich ore mines and gemstone quarries. They have vast financial resources, which they have used to hire a formidable force of mercenaries to protect their assets and enforce their will.

## Relationships

The Consortium has a working relationship with [[Stonepeak]], which is known for its rich mineral quarries. However, they are at odds with the [[Emberhold Council]], which seeks to regulate the mining industry and distribute its benefits more equitably. They also have a tense relationship with the [[Underminers]] and the [[Iron Guild]], who challenge their control over the mines and the iron-working industry, respectively.
