# Emberhold Mining Consortium

The Emberhold Mining Consortium is the largest and most influential mining corporation in the [[Cinderspire Expanse]]. It was founded by [[Gallus Giltroot]], a former miner who developed an efficient method of mineral extraction. Through a series of strategic acquisitions and less-than-ethical business practices, Giltroot expanded the Consortium into a mega-corporation that controls a significant portion of the region's mining industry. The Consortium's vast wealth and influence extend beyond the mining sector, impacting politics, economy, and social life across the Expanse.

## Corporate Activities

The Consortium's primary activity is the extraction and processing of minerals from the Expanse's rugged terrain. They operate a network of mines throughout the region, employing a significant portion of the Expanse's population. The Consortium is known for its relentless pursuit of efficiency and productivity, often at the expense of workers' welfare and environmental sustainability.

## Image and Propaganda

With its history of questionable business practices and ongoing issues with workers' rights and environmental damage, the Consortium struggles with a negative public image. To counter this, they invest heavily in public relations campaigns and corporate propaganda, often touting their contributions to the Expanse's economy and their supposed commitment to environmental responsibility.

## Labor Relations

The harsh working conditions and exploitation of workers in the Consortium's mines have led to considerable labor unrest. The [[Underminers]], originally a workers' group within the Consortium, became a radical faction advocating for workers' rights and improved conditions. The escalating conflict between the Consortium and the Underminers is a major source of tension in the Expanse.

## Political Influence

As the Expanse's economic powerhouse, the Consortium wields significant political influence. They use this power to suppress regulatory attempts, secure favorable contracts, and manipulate the political landscape to their advantage. The [[Emberhold Council]], while under the sway of Giltroot, often finds itself at odds with the Consortium's more ruthless tactics.

## Expansion and Espionage

The Consortium harbors ambitions to expand its operations beyond the Expanse. They actively pursue opportunities to establish mining operations in other regions and continents, sometimes resulting in conflict with foreign entities or local populations. To gain a competitive edge, the Consortium also engages in espionage. They are particularly interested in infiltrating [[Pyrothar's Keep]], hoping to uncover the technological secrets of [[Pyrothar]]. The Consortium also keeps a close eye on the [[Emberstone Society]] and the [[Technohermits]], suspecting that these factions possess knowledge that could further enhance their mining operations.

## Secret Research Division

Within the Consortium operates a covert research division dedicated to developing advanced mining technologies and deciphering the arcane mysteries of the world. These secretive pursuits hold the promise of game-changing breakthroughs but also pose significant risks if their experimental ventures go awry. The division's ultimate objective is to uncover the relics and clues within Pyrothar's Keep that point to the world's origins and the source of its magical technology.
