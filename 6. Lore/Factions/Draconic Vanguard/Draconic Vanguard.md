# Draconic Vanguard

The Draconic Vanguard are the remnants of Pyrothar's most loyal followers, who refuse to abandon the legacy of their once-mighty ruler. They are not content with mere religious observance or quiet reverence for the dragonâ€”instead, they actively seek to return the Expanse to draconic rule.

## Pursuit of Power

Members of the Draconic Vanguard believe in the supremacy of Pyrothar's rule and consider the time under his reign as the Expanse's golden age. They reject the notion of a democratic system as proposed by the [[Emberhold Council]], viewing it as weak and unsuited to the harsh realities of the Expanse.

## At Odds with the [[Emberhold Council]]

The Draconic Vanguard is diametrically opposed to the Emberhold Council's vision for the future. They see the council's democratic ideals as a threat to the Expanse's stability and view the council's leaders as usurpers who are unfit to rule.

Their confrontations with the council have been growing increasingly hostile, and it is only a matter of time before these tensions boil over into full-scale conflict.
