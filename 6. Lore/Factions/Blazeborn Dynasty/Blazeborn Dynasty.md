# Blazeborn Dynasty

The Blazeborn Dynasty is the ruling elite of [Cinderforge]. They are an old and respected family who claim to have been chosen by Pyrothar himself to oversee his dominion.

## Influence and Goals

In the power vacuum left by Pyrothar's disappearance, the Blazeborn Dynasty is rallying their forces and allies to assert control over the Expanse. They aim to maintain their position of power, believing that the stability of the Expanse is dependent on strong and unyielding leadership.

## Resources and Abilities

The Blazeborn Dynasty has managed to maintain control of the city through a combination of wealth, influence, and control over the city's foundries. The Dynasty is known for their mastery of fire magic, which they use in conjunction with their control of the foundries to produce high-quality weapons and armor.

## Relationships

The Dynasty has an uneasy alliance with the Draconic Vanguard, sharing a mutual respect for Pyrothar and a desire for strong leadership in the Expanse. However, they find themselves at odds with the [[Emberhold Council]] and the [[Iron Guild]], whose ideals clash with the autocratic vision of the Dynasty.
