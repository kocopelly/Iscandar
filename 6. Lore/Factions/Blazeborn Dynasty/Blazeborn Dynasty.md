# Blazeborn Dynasty

The Blazeborn Dynasty is the ruling house of [[Cinderforge]], a family with deep roots dating back to the reign of [[Pyrothar]]. They were once the premier blacksmiths and foundry operators, said to have been chosen by Pyrothar himself for their mastery of fire and metal. In the power vacuum that ensued after Pyrothar's disappearance, the military generals backed the Blazeborns to step into a governing role, establishing them as the autocratic rulers of the city.

## Influence and Goals

The Blazeborn Dynasty, currently led by [[Blazelord Mykos]], is walking a tightrope of governance in the wake of the war. While the family publicly maintains the stance of divine-right autocracy, internally, they're grappling with the complexities of managing a city torn apart by war and political division. Mykos personally dreams of a philosopher's kingdom, a utopia of wisdom and justice, but faces resistance within his own family who fear such radical changes could destabilize their rule and disrupt the balance of power in the Expanse.

## Resources and Abilities

The Blazeborn Dynasty's control over the foundries of Cinderforge is the cornerstone of their power. The Dynasty's wealth is deeply rooted in the production and trade of weapons and armor, forged with unique fire-magic techniques passed down through generations. This gives them an economic edge and serves as a symbol of their historical connection to Pyrothar and the power he represented.

## Relationships

The Blazeborn Dynasty's relationships are a complex network of alliances, rivalries, and uneasy truces. They share a strained alliance with the Draconic Vanguard, bound together by a shared reverence for Pyrothar and a common belief in strong leadership. However, their autocratic stance puts them at odds with the [[Emberhold Council]] and the [[Iron Guild]], both of which advocate for more democratic forms of governance.

In their own court, they face internal tension and political intrigue, as various members of the family vie for influence and power, challenging Mykos' leadership and his progressive ideals. Mykos' confidante and advisor, Maelis, secretly a member of the Emberstone Society, also subtly influences the dynasty, adding another layer of complexity to the Blazeborn's political tapestry.
