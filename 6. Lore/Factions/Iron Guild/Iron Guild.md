# Iron Guild

Formed during the tumultuous era of Pyrothar's reign, the Iron Guild was instrumental in balancing the power dynamics within the Cinderspire Expanse. The guild's foundation lies in its expertise in iron-working, a skill initially taught by Pyrothar to a select few fire mages.

## Fire Magic in Metallurgy

The Iron Guild has mastered the application of fire "magic" in the art of iron-working. This magic is in fact a deep understanding of the manipulation of heat and flame, made possible by the technological remnants of the ancient Saurians. Guild members utilize devices that can precisely control the temperature of their forges, allowing them to heat iron to its ideal working temperature with remarkable consistency.

Guildsmen also employ a form of "pyromancy" in their work, which is actually a clever application of thermodynamics and material science. Using small, handheld devices, they can channel heat directly into specific parts of the metal, allowing for precision forging and hardening processes.

This combination of advanced heating techniques and precise control over the working of metal results in weapons and armor of exceptional quality. The Iron Guild's products are highly sought after, contributing significantly to the stability and security of the Cinderspire Expanse.

## Democratization of Iron-Working

One of the core goals of the Iron Guild is to spread the knowledge and skills of iron-working among the populace. To this end, they offer apprenticeships and training programs to individuals showing a keen interest and aptitude in the craft.

Despite their secretive origins, the Iron Guild now operates openly, with the grand headquarters in Cinderforge serving as a testament to their success and influence.
