# The Underminers

The Underminers are a faction of miners and workers who have been exploited in the past. They seek better rights and conditions, and their strikes and riots can significantly impact the Expanse's economy and stability.

## Workers' Rights

The primary focus of the Underminers is the pursuit of better rights and conditions for the miners and workers of the Expanse. This includes fair wages, safer working conditions, and recognition of their critical role in the region's economy.

## Strikes and Riots

When negotiations fail, the Underminers are not afraid to take more drastic action. Their strikes and riots can significantly disrupt the mining operations in the Expanse, leading to economic instability and pushing the powers-that-be to heed their demands.
