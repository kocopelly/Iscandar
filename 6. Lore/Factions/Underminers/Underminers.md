# The Underminers

The Underminers is a radical faction originated within the [[Emberhold Mining Consortium]]. It was formed to fight for workers' rights and improved conditions, and to combat exploitation and neglect. The faction has since grown into a formidable force within the [[Cinderspire Expanse]].

## Leadership and Organization

The faction's leader, originally named [[Dorik Hammerfall]], now goes by the alias "The Foreman". Dorik was once a small-scale miner owner in Gritstone. His life took a tragic turn when his daughters were poisoned, an act orchestrated by the Consortium to coerce him into selling his mining operation. Learning the truth behind this tragedy, Dorik channeled his grief and anger into the formation of the Underminers.

Despite a central leadership figure, the Underminers are far from a monolithic organization. Each mine, company, or city has its own branch, each displaying varying degrees of autonomy and radicalism. This leads to a level of disarray within the faction, with individual branches often acting independently or even against the broader plans of the group.

## Evolution and Goals

What started as peaceful protests against the Consortium quickly escalated. The Underminers' struggle grew to include opposition to the [[Blazeborn Dynasty]] and the [[Emberhold Council]]. More radical elements within the faction envision a complete overthrow of the existing social order, to be replaced with a new, worker-owned society.

## Public Perception and Allies

Public opinion about the Underminers is split. To some, they are heroes standing up for the rights of the common people, while to others, they are dangerous anarchists. They count the Iron Guild among their allies, a secretive organization that works to steal and distribute secret technological and magical information.

## Underground Network

The Underminers make use of an extensive network of secret underground bases, hidden within the vast system of mining tunnels spread across the Cinderspire Expanse. This hidden network allows the Underminers to move, gather, and plan away from prying eyes, giving them a significant strategic advantage.

## Discovery of the Genetic Ark

Perhaps one of the most intriguing aspects of the Underminers is their discovery of evidence linked to the [[Genetic Ark]]. This relic, presumably of the [[Nexus of Escholalia]], suggests powerful secrets about the origins of life on [[Iscandar]]. The potential implications of this discovery could drastically alter the balance of power in the Cinderspire Expanse.
