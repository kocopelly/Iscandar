# Cinder Scribes

The Cinder Scribes are an offshoot of the [[Emberstone Society]], formed due to ideological differences regarding the dissemination of magic knowledge. They believe that such knowledge should be accessible to all, and they dedicate their efforts to educate the public.

## Public Education

The Cinder Scribes hold public lectures, publish easy-to-understand tomes on magic theory, and provide magical consultation to anyone who seeks it. Their goal is to demystify magic and make it a tool accessible to the masses.

## Opposition to the Emberstone Society

The Cinder Scribes lack the resources and influence of the Emberstone Society but make up for it with their grassroots support. They are often at odds with the [[Emberstone Society]], which believes in the restriction of magic knowledge to a select few.
