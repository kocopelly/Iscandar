# Ashen Wardens

The Ashen Wardens are a faction originating from the outskirts of major population centers in the Cinderspire Expanse. They first banded together to protect smaller towns from the chaos that permeates the Expanse. Now, they vie for political control in the larger population centers to prevent losing their autonomy to factions they consider less benevolent.

## Protection of the Small

The Ashen Wardens' initial mission was to protect smaller towns and communities from the uncertainties and dangers of the Expanse. They remain dedicated to this cause, often acting as the first line of defense against external threats.

## Seeking Control

Having proven their ability to maintain peace and order in the smaller communities, the Ashen Wardens are now setting their sights on the larger population centers. They seek political control in these areas, not for power, but to ensure their autonomy and the safety of the people.
