# Saurian Legion

The Saurian Legion is a group of formidable mercenaries hailing from a lush, tropical world far from the Expanse. These beings are unique, having undergone genetic and cybernetic enhancements in their homeland, resulting in a variety of distinct subspecies known as "genomorphs". Each genomorph is tailored for a specific role within their society, ranging from agile hunters to beings of immense power resembling dragons. 

## Mercenary Life

The Saurian Legion arrived during the war and opted to stay, offering their considerable combat prowess to the highest bidder. They possess knowledge and artifacts from their advanced civilization, which could sway the balance of power in the Expanse. 

## Genomorphs in the Legion

The legion consists of various genomorphs, each bringing their unique abilities to the battlefield. From the stealth and precision of the Serpentine, to the overwhelming force of the Behemoth, the Saurian Legion is a formidable force to be reckoned with. 

## Interaction with the Expanse

Their distinct appearance and foreign origin often put them at odds with local factions, yet their unmatched combat abilities make them a sought-after ally in the turbulent politics of the Expanse.
