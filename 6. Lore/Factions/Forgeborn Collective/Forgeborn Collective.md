# Forgeborn Collective

The Forgeborn Collective is a faction of blacksmiths and crafters, born out of the original members of the Iron Guild. However, unlike their predecessors who sought to share the secrets of iron-working for the greater good, the Forgeborn Collective has a different vision.

## Monopolizing Iron-Working

The Forgeborn Collective seeks to maintain a tight grip on the iron-working industry. They believe in the superiority of their craft and strive to ensure that the quality of iron-work remains highâ€”a goal they believe can only be achieved through stringent control.

## Opposition to the [[Iron Guild]]

The Forgeborn Collective is at odds with the Iron Guild's democratic ideals. They view the guild's approach as diluting the craft and undermining the value of their work. This has led to escalating tensions between the two factions, with the Forgeborn Collective seeking to undermine the [[Iron Guild]]'s influence wherever they can.
