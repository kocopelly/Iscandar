# Emberhold Council

In the aftermath of Pyrothar's retreat, the Cinderspire Expanse was left in a state of uncertainty. A power vacuum had been created, and there was a dire need for leadership and order. In response, the Emberhold Council was formed.

## Council Formation and Purpose

The Emberhold Council is a loose coalition of influential leaders from various city-states across the Expanse. Each city-state elects a representative to serve on the council, creating a diverse group of individuals with a range of perspectives and interests.

The council's goal is to establish a democratic form of governance in the Expanse. They believe that by giving each city-state a voice, they can create a fair and balanced system that serves the needs of all citizens.

## Challenges and Opposition

Despite their noble intentions, the Emberhold Council faces significant challenges. Various factions within the Expanse seek to fill the power vacuum and gain control over the region. These factions often clash with the council, leading to political disputes and, in some cases, open conflict.

Nevertheless, the Emberhold Council remains determined to establish a new order in the Cinderspire Expanse. Their struggle adds another layer of complexity to the intricate web of politics in the region.
