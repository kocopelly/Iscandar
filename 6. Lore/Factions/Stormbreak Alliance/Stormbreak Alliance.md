# Stormbreak Alliance

The Stormbreak Alliance is a faction hailing from the Stormhaven Plateau. They see the chaos in the Cinderspire Expanse as an opportunity to extend the influence of the Plateau and spread their belief in elemental balance.

## Elemental Balance

The Stormbreak Alliance firmly believes that the four elements – air, earth, fire, and water – must exist in harmony for the world to prosper. They aim to spread this belief across the Expanse and curb any actions that might disrupt this balance.

## Expansionist Ambitions

The Stormbreak Alliance is not content with maintaining peace and balance within the Stormhaven Plateau alone. They are actively working towards increasing their influence in the Cinderspire Expanse, viewing the current political chaos as an opportunity for expansion.
