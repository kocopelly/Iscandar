> [!column|no-t] 
> As life evolved on Iscandar, the beings that inhabited the world began to worship the dragons and other deities born from primordial energy. Spiritual and religious practices developed, reflecting the relationships between the dragons and their people. In Tidewhisper Shores, the benevolent Aquarion was revered by the Order of the Tidewhisper, led by High Priestess Alandra. In Stormhaven Plateau, the elusive Tempestar was honored by the Circle of the Storm, guided by Archdruid Thalenor. And in the Cinderspire Expanse, the dominant Pyrothar was worshipped by the Pyroclastic Order, ruled by Firelord Dravos.

> Ambition and power corrupted the heart of Pyrothar, who sought to dominate all of Iscandar. As the Cinderspire Expanse expanded its reach, the other regions banded together to resist the tyranny of the fire dragon. High Priestess Alandra united the people of Tidewhisper Shores, while Archdruid Thalenor rallied the forces of Stormhaven Plateau. Together, they waged a fierce battle against Firelord Dravos and the Pyroclastic Order. The Great War of Iscandar raged on, leaving a trail of devastation in its wake.
#### Volume IV: The Fall of Pyrothar and the Age of Reckoning
> [!column|no-t] 
> In the final battle, the allied forces defeated Pyrothar, who was believed to have perished. In truth, the wounded dragon fled Iscandar through the volcanic expanse, leaving the world behind. The Cinderspire Expanse fell into chaos, with the remnants of the Pyroclastic Order fragmenting into various factions. The other regions began rebuilding and healing, forging new paths in the absence of their draconic patrons. Aquarion established the Wardens of Aquarion, entrusting them with the protection of Tidewhisper Shores, while Tempestar retreated into solitude, leaving the Circle of the Storm to maintain balance in Stormhaven Plateau.
