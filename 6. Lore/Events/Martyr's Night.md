**Baruk Ironbeard**: In a previous generation, Baruk Ironbeard was a respected miner known for his fierce independence and stubborn refusal to bow to authority. Frustrated by the oppressive rule of the Blazeborn Dynasty, he orchestrated a daring attack against the Dynasty's stronghold in Cinderforge. Using his knowledge of the city's underground tunnels, Baruk and his team were able to infiltrate the stronghold and destroy a significant portion of the Dynasty's weapon stores, dealing a blow to their military power.

Although the attack did not kill any high-ranking members of the Dynasty, it marked the first significant challenge to their rule. Baruk was captured in the aftermath and was publicly executed in Cinderforge's central square. His last words, defiantly calling for the people of Cinderforge to rise up against their oppressors, resonated with many and turned him into a symbol of resistance against the Blazeborn Dynasty. His death became a catalyst for the formation of groups like the Underminers and his name is still invoked today as a call to action. His martyrdom is commemorated every year in an event known as Ironbeard's Remembrance.
