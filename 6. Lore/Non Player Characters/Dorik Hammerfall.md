# Dorik Hammerfall (The Foreman)

Dorik Hammerfall, better known by his alias "The Foreman", is the founder and leader of the radical faction known as the [[Underminers]]. Originating from the mining town of [[Gritstone]], Dorik was a small-time mine owner who experienced a profound personal tragedy that served as the catalyst for his radicalization.

## Personal Tragedy and the Birth of the Underminers

Dorik owned and operated a small mine in [[Gritstone]], steadfastly refusing to sell it to the expanding [[Emberhold Mining Consortium]]. In response, the Consortium poisoned his daughters, driving him to desperation. Faced with mounting medical bills, Dorik was left with no choice but to sell his mine to pay for the treatment to save his daughters. Unfortunately, only one of his daughters survived.

Destitute and with no other options, Dorik found himself working in the very mine he once owned. During his time as a worker, he stumbled upon a horrifying truth when he witnessed the Consortium's underhanded tactics employed on another mine owner. He discovered stashes of the same poison used on his daughters, confirming his worst suspicions about the Consortium's tactics. This discovery was the last straw for Dorik. Driven by a mixture of grief, guilt, and rage, he formed the Underminers, an organization dedicated to fighting against the Consortium and improving conditions for miners.

## Leadership Style and Influence

As The Foreman, Dorik's leadership style is bold and charismatic. His humble origins and personal story resonate with the economically downtrodden, adding to his appeal. Despite the Underminers' decentralized structure, Dorik's influence is still keenly felt across all branches of the faction.

## Vision and Goals

Dorik envisions a society where workers aren't exploited but instead have ownership and control over their work. He is prepared to go to any lengths to achieve this goal, including advocating for the complete overthrow of the current social order in the Cinderspire Expanse.

## Discovery of the Genetic Ark

One of the most significant developments under Dorik's leadership has been the discovery of evidence linked to the [[Genetic Ark]]. The potential implications of this find, and how Dorik chooses to use this information, could drastically alter the trajectory of the struggle in the [[Cinderspire Expanse]].
