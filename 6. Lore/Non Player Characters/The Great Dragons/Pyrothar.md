# Pyrothar

## Saurian Origins

Pyrothar is a [[6. Lore/Races/Sauromorphs/Drakonid|Drakonid]], a dragon-like genomorph created by the [[Saurians]] civilization. His alignment with Praxis, one part of the Saurian religious [[Triad]], meant he was driven to enact change and create progress at any cost.

## Journey to Iscandar

Like his fellow Drakonids, Pyrothar journeyed to Iscandar seeking freedom and a new home. Upon arrival, he was drawn to the [[3. Cinderspire Expanse|Cinderspire Expanse]], a harsh, volcanic region that suited his fiery nature.

## First Age of Iscandar

In this age, Pyrothar established an authoritarian rule over the Cinderspire Expanse. Using his power and influence, he shaped the land and its people to his will, creating a society defined by strength and ambition.

## The Great War

Pyrothar started the [[Great War]], seeking to expand his control over all of Iscandar. He was ultimately defeated by the combined forces of Aquarion, Tempestar, and their allied people. After his defeat, Pyrothar fled Iscandar, vowing to return.

## Exile and Return

In exile, Pyrothar sought powerful allies and amassed a force of mercenaries from other worlds, including Saurian [[Sauromorphs|genomorphs]]. He plans his return to Iscandar, driven by a burning desire to reclaim what he believes is rightfully his.
