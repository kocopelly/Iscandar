# Aquarion

## Saurian Origins

Aquarion was among the first Drakonid genomorphs created by the Saurians. As a living embodiment of the Saurian principle of Synthesis, Aquarion was designed to have a deep connection with the forces of nature, and particularly with water.

## Journey to Iscandar

Disenchanted with the Saurian obsession with technological progress at the expense of their connection to nature, Aquarion, alongside Tempestar and Pyrothar, left their homeworld to find a place where they could live in harmony with the natural world. This journey led them to Iscandar.

## First Age of Iscandar

On Iscandar, Aquarion embraced the planet's abundant waters and aquatic life. Over time, he became a nurturing figure for the emerging humanoid societies on the planet, teaching them to live in harmony with the planet's ecosystems.

## The Great War

During the Great War, Aquarion allied with Tempestar and their respective peoples against Pyrothar, who sought to dominate Iscandar. Despite their initial reluctance to engage in conflict, Aquarion recognized the necessity of protecting Iscandar's balance from Pyrothar's destructive ambitions.
