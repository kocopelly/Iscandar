# Tempestar

## Saurian Origins

Tempestar, like its kin, originated from the advanced Saurian civilization. A Drakonid genomorph with a special affinity for the elements of air and storm, Tempestar was considered a marvel of Saurian biotechnology. Despite its incredible power, Tempestar was one of the most introspective and philosophical of the Saurians, often questioning the path their civilization was taking.

## Journey to Iscandar

Leaving their home behind, Tempestar, along with Aquarion and Pyrothar, journeyed across the cosmos to Iscandar. Their reasons were varied, but for Tempestar, it was a search for balance and tranquility that drove them.

## First Age of Iscandar

Upon arriving in Iscandar, Tempestar made a home in the Stormhaven Plateau, a region of wild and untamed natural beauty. It was here that Tempestar and its followers began to establish a society based on respect for nature and balance in all things, drawing inspiration from the local druidic traditions.

## The Great War

During the Great War, Tempestar and Aquarion found themselves allied against Pyrothar. In the aftermath of the war, Tempestar retreated into solitude, using this time to meditate on the events that had transpired and the nature of existence itself.
