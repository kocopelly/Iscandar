# Councillor Gallus Giltroot

Gallus Giltroot is the current head of the [[Emberhold Council]]. His leadership of the council has been marked by a focus on pragmatic decision-making, economic productivity, and an emphasis on meritocracy.

## From Rags to Riches

Giltroot's personal story is a compelling one. Born into a poor family, he rose from a humble background to become one of the most influential figures in the [[Cinderspire Expanse]]. He attributes his success to a combination of hard work, smart decisions, and a healthy dose of luck. Starting his career as a miner, Gallus invented a more efficient method of extracting minerals from the rugged terrain of the Expanse. The wealth he amassed from his patented extraction method allowed him to buy mines throughout Emberhold, forming the Emberhold Mining Consortium. Gallus now controls a significant portion of the mining industry and his influence is felt across the entire Expanse.

## Meritocracy and Economic Focus

Under Giltroot's leadership, the Emberhold Council has prioritized economic productivity and efficiency. He strongly believes that opportunities and rewards should be based on individual merit and contribution, rather than inherited status or wealth. This focus on meritocracy has led to policies that support entrepreneurs and innovators, as well as initiatives aimed at improving the productivity of the Expanse's industries.

## Popular Leader

Despite his bluntness and focus on economics, Giltroot is a popular figure among the city's workers and industrialists. His rags-to-riches story resonates with many, giving them hope that they too can succeed in the harsh world of the Cinderspire Expanse. Furthermore, his straight-talking manner and lack of pretension set him apart from the stereotypical image of a detached, out-of-touch leader.

## Goals

Giltroot's primary goal is to increase the influence and authority of the Emberhold Council. He believes that the stability and prosperity of the Cinderspire Expanse can best be achieved through a government that values merit, hard work, and economic productivity. However, his ambitions are often checked by the autocratic rule of the [[Blazeborn Dynasty]].

## Controversy

Despite his success, Gallus' relentless pursuit of productivity and efficiency has led to controversial practices. His mines are known for their harsh working conditions and environmental impact. This has led to clashes with the Underminers and other groups advocating for better working conditions and environmental conservation, adding another layer of complexity to the political landscape of Emberhold and the Cinderspire Expanse.
