# Blazelord Mykos

Blazelord Mykos Blazeborn is the current ruler of Cinderforge, heading the Blazeborn Dynasty. Mykos was a young boy during the war and carries the memories of the conflict deeply embedded within him. The devastation, chaos, and loss left a lasting impression on his mind, shaping him into the man he is today. Mykos is a skeptic, a survivor, and a reformist - all rolled into one. The ideas of philosophers and scholars have influenced him, leading him to believe in the evils of war and the necessity for peaceful coexistence.

## Philosophical Beliefs

Mykos dreams of a philosopher's kingdom, a utopia governed by wisdom, justice, and enlightenment rather than sheer force or inherited right. He holds that leaders should be chosen for their knowledge, wisdom, and moral virtue. This dream conflicts with the traditional autocratic rule of the Blazeborn Dynasty, causing internal friction within the family.

## Skepticism and Survival

The harsh realities of war and politics have made Mykos inherently skeptical of everyone around him. He trusts no one completely and is always prepared for betrayal. His approach to governance is pragmatic and survivalist, shaped by the specter of the war that looms in his past.

## Political Challenges

While Mykos yearns for reform, he isn't particularly adept at the political machinations necessary to enact the changes he dreams of. His rule is a constant balancing act, trying to navigate the fine line between his progressive ideals and the conservative elements within the Dynasty. His political journey is one of struggle and resilience as he tries to reconcile his philosophical beliefs with the harsh realities of ruling a city in the volatile Cinderspire Expanse.

## Secret Influence

Mykos' closest confidante and advisor, Maelis, is a secret member of the Emberstone Society. Unbeknownst to Mykos, Maelis subtly influences him towards the society's ideas, providing a steady flow of philosophy, science, and culture to shape Mykos' worldview. This clandestine relationship adds an extra layer of intrigue to the political landscape of Cinderforge and Mykos' personal story.
