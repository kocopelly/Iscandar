# Raptor

## Overview

Raptors are a genomorph race of the Saurian civilization, designed for speed, hunting, and combat. With their razor-sharp claws, heightened senses, and explosive speed, they are fearsome predators.

## Origin

Raptors were engineered by the Saurians to serve as hunters and warriors, combining their own DNA with that of various swift and deadly reptilian species. The result is a formidable genomorph built for speed and violence.

## Features

Raptors are distinguished by their speed and their ferociousness in combat. Their keen senses and lightning-quick reflexes make them excellent hunters, and their retractable claws can deliver devastating attacks.
