# Psynapses

## Overview

Psynapses are a genomorph race of the Saurian civilization, representing the pinnacle of their experimentation with psionic abilities. Psynapses are masters of the mind, able to read thoughts, influence others, and even lash out with raw psychic energy.

## Origin

Psynapses were born out of the Saurians' pursuit of the ultimate strategist and diplomat. Through genetic manipulation and advanced cognitive enhancement, the Saurians were successful in creating a genomorph capable of near-perfect probability predictions and deep understanding of psychology.

## Features

Psynapses possess several unique features that distinguish them from other genomorphs and represent the height of Saurian biotechnology.
