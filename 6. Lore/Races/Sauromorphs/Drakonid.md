# Drakonids

## Overview

Drakonids are a genomorph race of the Saurian civilization, engineered to resemble dragons of myth and legend. With wings, scales, and the ability to breathe elemental energy, they stand as a testament to the Saurians' mastery of biotechnology.
## Origin

Drakonids were created as an ambitious project within the Saurian society to harness the primal power of dragons. Using advanced genetic manipulation techniques, Saurians combined their own DNA with genetic material derived from various powerful reptilian creatures, resulting in the creation of the Drakonids.

## Features

Drakonids have several unique features that distinguish them from other genomorphs and make them formidable entities.
