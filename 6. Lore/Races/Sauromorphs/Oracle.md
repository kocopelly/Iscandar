# Oracles

## Overview

Oracles represent the pinnacle of the [[Saurians|Saurian]]'s bio-engineering prowess. They are genomorphs designed for intelligence, strategy, and foresight. Using advanced genetic and cybernetic modifications, Oracles possess an intellect far beyond any natural creature and have the unique ability to predict future events through probabilistic modeling.

## Origin

The Oracle project was born out of the Saurians' desire to predict and plan for every possible outcome. They combined their most advanced AI technology with their own genetic material, creating a new genomorph that possessed both the Saurian's biological traits and the cold calculating intellect of an AI. The result was the Oracle, a creature of living flesh and synthetic circuits, capable of foreseeing potential futures with astonishing accuracy.

## Features

Oracles are unique among Saurians and other genomorphs due to their in-built AI and access to vast amounts of data. They are highly valued for their intelligence and strategic abilities, often serving in advisory roles to Saurian leaders and strategists.
