# Behemoth

## Overview

Behemoths are the most physically imposing genomorph race of the Saurian civilization, engineered for strength and endurance. Their bodies are massive, resembling that of a prehistoric triceratops, and are covered in a thick, armored hide that can withstand most physical attacks. They are the workforce and the shield of the Saurian community, often used in heavy labor and warfare.

## Origin

The Saurian scientists created the Behemoths to meet the needs of the Saurian civilization for manual labor and defense. They combined the DNA of various prehistoric creatures known for their size and strength to form the Behemoth genomorphs.

## Features

Besides their strength and hardiness, Behemoths are recognized for their loyalty and stoicism. They carry out their tasks without complaint, often working in conditions that other Saurians would find unbearable. Despite their intimidating appearance, Behemoths are gentle unless provoked, always preferring to protect rather than to harm.
