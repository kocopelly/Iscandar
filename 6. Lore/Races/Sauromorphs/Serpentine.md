# Serpentine

## Overview

Serpentines are one of the genomorph races created by the Saurian civilization, primarily designed for stealth, precision, and agility. With their slender bodies and swift, quiet movements, they excel at covert operations and precise strikes.

## Origin

Serpentines were conceived as a response to the Saurians' need for stealth operatives. Their genetic blueprint incorporates traits from various snake species, emphasizing stealth, agility, and the ability to strike with lethal precision.

## Features

Distinct from other genomorphs, Serpentines are known for their venomous bite, which can paralyze or incapacitate their foes. Their exceptional agility allows them to navigate complex terrains swiftly and quietly, while their slender bodies aid in stealth and infiltration. These features combined make them lethal operatives on and off the battlefield.
