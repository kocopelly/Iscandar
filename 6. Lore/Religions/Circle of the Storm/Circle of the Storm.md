# Circle of the Storm

The Circle of the Storm is a reclusive group of mages, scholars, and druids residing in the Stormhaven Plateau. They are devoted to the study of the elemental forces and the understanding of Tempestar's will. The Circle prefers to stay out of the political and military conflicts of the world and focus on the pursuit of knowledge and the development of their magical abilities.

The Circle of the Storm believes in the power of the Great Gale, a mythical storm that shaped the world and continues to shape their destinies. Tempestar, the dragon of storms, is seen as the Eye of the Gale, a calm and guiding presence amidst the chaos of life. They view magic as the harnessing of the storm's power, with practitioners learning to channel the wild and unpredictable energies of the Gale.

Balance, wisdom, and resilience are the core values of the Circle. They believe that, like a storm, life brings both destruction and renewal, and it is their role to navigate and learn from these changes. The Circle's responsibilities include understanding the "winds of change" to predict and prepare for future events. They serve as advisors, scholars, and sometimes even weather predictors.

In their pursuit of knowledge, the Circle of the Storm has established monastic orders and secret societies dedicated to arcane studies. Initiates strive to unravel the enigmatic teachings of Tempestar and achieve a higher state of consciousness. They seek to understand the secrets of the world and unlock the hidden power within themselves.

Besides Tempestar, the pantheon of the Circle includes entities representing different aspects of the storm. Fulmen, the deity of lightning and sudden change, symbolizes the unpredictable nature of storms. Nimbus, the deity of clouds and hidden potentials, represents the untapped power within each individual.

> [!note] **Meta description**
> The members of the Circle unknowingly use weather-controlling technology leftover from Saurian times. Their rituals to predict and control the weather are actually accessing and issuing commands to an ancient weather control system. Their "magic" often involves electro-tech, using devices that can generate or manipulate electricity and static charges, which is perceived as storm or lightning magic. For instance, their ability to "summon storms" might be due to activating weather-modifying satellites or geo-engineering machines.
