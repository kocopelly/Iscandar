# Pyroclastic Order

The Pyroclastic Order is a military and religious faction devoted to the worship of Pyrothar, the dragon of fire, and the enforcement of his will. Composed of fire mages, warlocks, and warriors, the Pyroclastic Order serves as both the enforcers of the Firelord's rule and the guardians of Pyrothar's sacred flame.

The Order follows the doctrine of the "Eternal Flame," a belief system that promotes personal strength and ambition. Pyrothar is revered as the Blazeheart, embodying unyielding will and power. Magic is seen as the spark of the Eternal Flame within oneself, and its mastery is seen as a sign of personal strength and dominance.

The Pyroclastic Order values power, control, and ambition. They believe that, like a fire, a person must consume or be consumed. Their responsibilities revolve around maintaining order through strength, ruling through fear, and displays of power. They believe that only the strongest flames should lead.

Alongside Pyrothar, the pantheon of the Order includes entities representing different aspects of fire and power. Incindra, the deity of wildfires and unrestrained passion, symbolizes the unbridled and destructive nature of fire. Ignis, the deity of hearth and home, represents the controlled and nurturing aspect of fire.

The Pyroclastic Order maintains temples and fortresses dedicated to the worship of Pyrothar. They perform grand ceremonies and fiery rituals to honor their dragon deity and demonstrate their loyalty and devotion. The Order's members undergo rigorous training in martial combat and fire-based magic, seeking to embody the strength and power of Pyrothar.

> [!note] **Meta description**
> The Pyroclastic Order unknowingly uses advanced pyro-tech and energy manipulation devices. Their rituals often involve the use of these devices to control and create fire or heat-based phenomena. For instance, their "fire magic" is often the result of high-energy plasma manipulation using Saurian technology. They might have devices that can cause spontaneous combustion or manipulate thermal energy, creating illusions of fire manipulation and immunity. Their intimidation tactics might involve controlled use of these devices to demonstrate their "divine" power.
