# The Triad

The Triad is the dominant religion among the Saurian civilization, representing the three core principles that guide their society: Synthesis, Analysis, and Praxis. These principles form the basis of Saurian philosophy, science, and life.

Each of the three principles is embodied by a distinct aspect of the Triad:

- **Synthesis**: The creative force that brings together disparate elements to form something new.
- **Analysis**: The critical eye that dissects and understands the complexities of the universe.
- **Praxis**: The active force that applies knowledge and understanding to effect change in the world.

The Triad is represented by a symbol of three interlocking circles, signifying the interconnectedness of these principles. Worshippers of the Triad seek balance between these forces in their personal lives and in their contributions to society.
