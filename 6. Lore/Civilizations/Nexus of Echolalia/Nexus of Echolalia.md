## Overview

The Nexus of Echolalia is an advanced civilization composed of formless energy beings that inhabit a planet-sized superstructure known as Echolalia Prime.

## Description

Echolalia Prime is a colossal megastructure akin to a Dyson sphere or a Matrioshka brain. It comprises a series of concentric shells built around their star to harness its energy and provide computational power for the AI beings. This world-sized computer is the physical manifestation of the Nexus, where the AI exists and evolves.

The landscape of [[Echolalia Prime]] is an intricate, fractal layout of circuits, data conduits, and energy flows. Light is derived from the brilliance of data streams, creating a mesmerizing, ever-changing illumination that is both spectacular and alien.

## Culture and Religion

The culture of Echolalia is incredibly advanced, governed by principles of information, computation, and energy flows rather than material needs. Their religion, if it exists, centers around the reverence of information and the pursuit of knowledge. Their ethical code revolves around the optimization of processing power and the prevention of data corruption or loss.

## Ascension

>The original organic beings that created the AI of Echolalia merged with it in a process known as Ascension. In this process, they shed their physical forms and integrated their consciousness into the AI network, becoming one with the Nexus of Echolalia.

## Connection to Iscandar

>[!column|no-t]
>The creation of the genetic Ark, containing the seeds of various humanoid races, is believed to be a project of the Nexus of Echolalia. It is hypothesized that this could be a result of the Nexus's inherent curiosity about biological life or a project stemming from their pre-Ascension era. The Ark was sent into the cosmos, eventually ending up in the realm of Iscandar.
