# Saurian Civilization
## Origins
>[!column| no-t]
>The Saurians originated from the lush, tropical world of [[Sauria]], a planet blessed with vast oceans, towering mountains, and sprawling jungles teeming with life. Their society thrived in harmony with nature until the discovery of advanced technology, which ushered in an era of unprecedented growth and development. 
>This transformative period in their history saw the advent of genetic engineering and cybernetics, allowing the Saurians to manipulate their own genetics. They created [[Sauromorphs|genomorphs]], distinct sub-species tailored for specific roles within society. The most profound of these enhancements were undertaken by the select few who became Dragons - Saurians who had undergone radical genetic and cybernetic enhancements to become beings of immense power.

>The Saurians harnessed the energy of their sun, powering their vast cities and technological wonders. As they evolved alongside their technology, a philosophical belief known as the [[Triad]] emerged. Representing the balance of Synthesis, Analysis, and Praxis, the Triad was at the heart of Saurian society. 
## Technology 
1.  **Biotechnology:** This is a key area of Saurian advancement, allowing them to alter their genetic structure and create genomorphs. Saurians have developed advanced gene-editing tools, synthetic biology, and bioinformatics.
    
2.  **Cybernetics:** Saurians have mastered the fusion of biology and machinery. They have developed advanced prosthetics, neural interfaces, and even life-sustaining cybernetic organs.
    
3.  **Energy Technology:** Saurians have created highly efficient and sustainable energy sources. This includes harnessing the power of their home star, advanced nuclear fusion, and quantum energy manipulation.
    
4.  **Nanotechnology:** At the smallest scale, Saurians manipulate matter. This has applications in medicine, materials science, and computing.
    
5.  **Astrotech:** This includes faster-than-light travel, advanced propulsion systems, and terraforming technologies.
## Genomorphology

| **Triton**       | Aquatic genomorphs, they have fins, gills, and are adapted to deep-sea environments.                                       |
| **[[Chameleon]]**    | These Saurians can change their skin color at will, making them master of stealth and deception.                           |
| **Behemoth**     | The largest of the Saurians, these genomorphs are used for heavy labor and warfare. They resemble prehistoric dinosaurs.  |
| **Strategos**    | Engineered for leadership and strategy, these Saurians have highly developed problem-solving and tactical abilities.      |
| **[[Psynapse]]**     | These Saurians are gifted with advanced cognitive abilities, including enhanced memory, processing speed, and creativity. |
| **Empathos**     | Developed with advanced emotional intelligence, these Saurians excel in diplomacy, conflict resolution, and counseling.   |
| **[[Oracle]]**       | Genetically enhanced for foresight, these Saurians have an uncanny ability to predict probable outcomes.                  |
| **Mentor**       | These Saurians are designed for teaching and knowledge dissemination, possessing vast knowledge and patience.            |

## Exodus
>[!column| no-t]
>However, the rapid pace of technological advancement began to create a disconnect with their natural world. Three Dragons, [[7. Mechanics/Beastiary/Sauromorphs/Aquarion|Aquarion]], [[7. Mechanics/Beastiary/Sauromorphs/Tempestar|Tempestar]], and [[7. Mechanics/Beastiary/Sauromorphs/Pyrothar|Pyrothar]], grew disillusioned with the state of their society. Guided by the principles of the Triad, they decided to leave Sauria in search of a world where they could restore the balance between nature, knowledge, and technology. Their journey led them to Iscandar. Here, they saw the potential to create a society that embraced both the wonders of technology and the beauty of the natural world.
