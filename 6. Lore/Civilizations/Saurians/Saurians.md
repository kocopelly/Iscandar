# Saurian Civilization
## Origins
>[!column| no-t]
>The Saurians, an ancient reptilian civilization, originated from the lush and tropical world of Sauria. This planet, blessed with vast oceans, towering mountains, and sprawling jungles teeming with life, served as their ancestral home. For eons, they thrived in symbiotic harmony with the natural world, cherishing the wonders it offered. 
><br>However, a pivotal turning point came when the Saurians unlocked the secrets of advanced technology. This momentous discovery ushered in an era of unprecedented growth and development. Within this transformative phase of their history, the Saurians delved into the realm of genetic engineering and cybernetics, wielding these scientific disciplines to shape their own biology.

>Among the varied genomorphs created to fulfill specific roles within society, the Dragons emerged as the pinnacle of these enhancements. Through radical genetic and cybernetic modifications, a select few Saurians were transformed into majestic and formidable beings. Dragons possessed immense power and stood as testaments to the Saurians' mastery of their own genetics.
><br>Harnessing the boundless energy of their sun, the Saurians powered their sprawling cities and awe-inspiring technological wonders. As their civilization evolved alongside their technological advancements, a profound philosophical belief known as the Triad took root. At the heart of Saurian society, the Triad represented the delicate balance between Synthesis, Analysis, and Praxis. It guided their cultural, scientific, and technological endeavors, shaping the very fabric of their existence.
## Technology 
1.  **Biotechnology:** This is a key area of Saurian advancement, allowing them to alter their genetic structure and create genomorphs. Saurians have developed advanced gene-editing tools, synthetic biology, and bioinformatics.
    
2.  **Cybernetics:** Saurians have mastered the fusion of biology and machinery. They have developed advanced prosthetics, neural interfaces, and even life-sustaining cybernetic organs.
    
3.  **Energy Technology:** Saurians have created highly efficient and sustainable energy sources. This includes harnessing the power of their home star, advanced nuclear fusion, and quantum energy manipulation.
    
4.  **Nanotechnology:** At the smallest scale, Saurians manipulate matter. This has applications in medicine, materials science, and computing.
    
5.  **Astrotech:** This includes faster-than-light travel, advanced propulsion systems, and terraforming technologies.

## Exodus
>[!column| no-t]
>However, the rapid pace of technological advancement began to create a disconnect with their natural world. Three Dragons, [[7. Mechanics/Beastiary/Sauromorphs/Aquarion|Aquarion]], [[7. Mechanics/Beastiary/Sauromorphs/Tempestar|Tempestar]], and [[7. Mechanics/Beastiary/Sauromorphs/Pyrothar|Pyrothar]], grew disillusioned with the state of their society. Guided by the principles of the Triad, they decided to leave Sauria in search of a world where they could restore the balance between nature, knowledge, and technology. Their journey led them to Iscandar. Here, they saw the potential to create a society that embraced both the wonders of technology and the beauty of the natural world.
