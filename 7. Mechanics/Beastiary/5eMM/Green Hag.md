        magical illusion that makes her look like another creature of her general
        size and humanoid shape. The illusion ends if the hag takes a bonus action
        to end it or if she dies.'

-   desc: ' The hag magically turns invisible until she attacks or casts a spell,
        or until her concentration ends (as if concentrating on a spell). While invisible,
        she leaves no physical evidence of her passage, so she can be tracked only
        by magic. Any equipment she wears or carries is invisible with her.'
