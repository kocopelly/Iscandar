-   desc: " A 10-foot radius of disgusting green gas extends out from the dretch.\
        \ The gas spreads around corners, and its area is lightly obscured. It lasts\
        \ for 1 minute or until a strong wind disperses it. Any creature that starts\
        \ its turn in that area must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw\
        \ or be poisoned until the start of its next turn. While poisoned in this\
        \ way, the target can take either an action or a bonus action on its turn,\
        \ not both, and can\u2019t take reactions."
