    name: Claws (Hag Form Only).
-   desc: " The hag magically polymorphs into a Small or Medium female humanoid, or\
        \ back into her true form. Her statistics are the same in each form. Any equipment\
        \ she is wearing or carrying isn\u2019t transformed. She reverts to her true\
        \ form if she dies."
    name: Change Shape.
-   desc: ' The hag magically enters the Ethereal Plane from the Material Plane, or
        vice versa. To do so, the hag must have a heartstone in her possession.'
    name: Etherealness.
-   desc: " While on the Ethereal Plane, the hag magically touches a sleeping humanoid\
        \ on the Material Plane. A protection from evil and good spell cast on the\
        \ target prevents this contact, as does a magic circle. As long as the contact\
        \ persists, the target has dreadful visions. If these visions last for at\
        \ least 1 hour, the target gains no benefit from its rest, and its hit point\
        \ maximum is reduced by 5 (1d10). If this effect reduces the target\u2019\
        s hit point maximum to 0, the target dies, and if the target was evil, its\
        \ soul is trapped in the hag\u2019s soul bag. The reduction to the target\u2019\
        s hit point maximum lasts until removed by the greater restoration spell or\
        \ similar magic."
