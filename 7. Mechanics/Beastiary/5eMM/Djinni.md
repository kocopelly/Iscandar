-   desc: ' A 5-foot-radius, 30-foot-tall cylinder of swirling air magically forms
        on a point the djinni can see within 120 feet of it. The whirlwind lasts as
        long as the djinni maintains concentration (as if concentrating on a spell).
        Any creature but the djinni that enters the whirlwind must succeed on a DC
        18 Strength saving throw or be restrained by it. The djinni can move the whirlwind
        up to 60 feet as an action, and creatures restrained by the whirlwind move
        with it. The whirlwind ends if the djinni loses sight of it.'
