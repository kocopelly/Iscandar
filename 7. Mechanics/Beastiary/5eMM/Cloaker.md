-   desc: " Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 10 (2d6\
        \ + 3) piercing damage, and if the target is Large or smaller, the cloaker\
        \ attaches to it. If the cloaker has advantage against the target, the cloaker\
        \ attaches to the target\u2019s head, and the target is blinded and unable\
        \ to breathe while the cloaker is attached. While attached, the cloaker can\
        \ make this attack only against the target and has advantage on the attack\
        \ roll. The cloaker can detach itself by spending 5 feet of its movement.\
        \ A creature, including the target, can take its action to detach the cloaker\
        \ by succeeding on a DC 16 Strength check."

        \ that isn\u2019t an aberration must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw\
        \ or become frightened until the end of the cloaker\u2019s next turn. If a\
        \ creature\u2019s saving throw is successful, the creature is immune to the\
        \ cloaker\u2019s moan for the next 24 hours"
    name: Moan.
-   desc: " The cloaker magically creates three illusory duplicates of itself if it\
        \ isn\u2019t in bright light. The duplicates move with it and mimic its actions,\
        \ shifting position so as to make it impossible to track which cloaker is\
        \ the real one. If the cloaker is ever in an area of bright light, the duplicates\
        \ disappear."
