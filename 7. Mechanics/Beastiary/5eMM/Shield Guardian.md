-   desc: " The shield guardian is magically bound to an amulet. As long as the guardian\
        \ and its amulet are on the same plane of existence, the amulet\u2019s wearer\
        \ can telepathically call the guardian to travel to it, and the guardian knows\
        \ the distance and direction to the amulet. If the guardian is within 60 feet\
        \ of the amulet\u2019s wearer, half of any damage the wearer takes (rounded\
        \ up) is transferred to the guardian."

-   desc: ". A spellcaster who wears the shield guardian\u2019s amulet can cause the\
        \ guardian to store one spell of 4th level or lower. To do so, the wearer\
        \ must cast the spell on the guardian. The spell has no effect but is stored\
        \ within the guardian. When commanded to do so by the wearer or when a situation\
        \ arises that was predefined by the spellcaster, the guardian casts the stored\
        \ spell with any parameters set by the original caster, requiring no components.\
        \ When the spell is cast or a new spell is stored, any previously stored spell\
        \ is lost."
