-   desc: " Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 12 (2d8\
        \ + 3) piercing damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a\
        \ DC 15 Constitution saving throw against disease or become poisoned until\
        \ the disease is cured. Every 24 hours that elapse, the target must repeat\
        \ the saving throw, reducing its hit point maximum by 5 (1d10) on a failure.\
        \ The disease is cured on a success. The target dies if the disease reduces\
        \ its hit point maximum to 0. This reduction to the target\u2019s hit point\
        \ maximum lasts until the disease is cured."
