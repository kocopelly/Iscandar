    - { name: 'Spit Fire', desc: 'The dragon targets a creature within 60 feet, forcing it to make a DC 21 Dexterity saving throw. The creature takes 22 (4d10) fire damage on a failure or half damage on a success. A creature that fails the save also takes 5 (1d10) ongoing fire damage. A creature can use an action to end the ongoing damage.' }
    - { name: 'Fire Breath (Recharge 5Â–6)', desc: 'The dragon exhales a blast of fire in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area makes a DC 21 Dexterity saving throw, taking 73 (21d6) fire damage on a failed save or half damage on a success.

    - { name: 'When fighting in the open, dragons often circle above their enemies as they wait for their breath weapons to recharge', desc: "They only close to melee if their enemies deal significant damage with ranged attacks, or if they can savage an enemy cut off from its allies. Once bloodied, dragons become more aggressive, attacking with bite and claws when their breath weapons aren't available." }
    - { name: 'If a dragon is protecting its lair, it utilizes lair features, traps, allies, and architecture such as escape tunnels to keep up a hit-and-run fight, reappearing only when it has a fully-recharged breath weapon', desc: 'If the dragon is forced into melee combat, it uses its bite and claws against a single foe. If it has legendary actions like Roar and Wing Attack, it uses them to disperse its other enemies.' }
    - { name: 'If reduced to less than one-fourth its hit points while fighting in the open, a dragon flies away', desc: 'However, it fights to the death to defend its lair, unless it can regain the upper hand through tricks or bargains.' }
