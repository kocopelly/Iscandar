When a creature shares its space with the whirlwind for the first time during this movement, that creature makes a DC 15 Strength saving throw. On a failure, the creature is carried inside the elemental's space until the whirlwind ends, taking 3 (1d6) bludgeoning damage for each 10 feet it is carried, and falls prone at the end of the movement. The whirlwind can carry one Large creature or up to four Medium or smaller creatures." }

Otherwise, it makes a slam attack on creatures within its reach or sharing its space. Elementals retreat only if ordered to do so.' }
