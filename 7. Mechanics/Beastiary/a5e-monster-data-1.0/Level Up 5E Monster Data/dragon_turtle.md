combat:

It generally uses its tail only as a reaction, unless it wants to push a melee combatant before retreating. It uses Lightning Storm when it can't otherwise reach its enemies. It attacks with its claws every turn. Dragon turtles flee into deep water when bloodied; if pursued, they turn around once their Steam Breath recharges and fight to the death." }
