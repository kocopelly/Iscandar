A creature can take this damage only once per turn. If the wight has been subjected to fire damage since its last turn, this trait doesn't function." }

'bonus actions':
    - { name: 'Life Drain', desc: "Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 6 (1d8 + 2) necrotic damage, and the target makes a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the target's hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage dealt. The reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. A humanoid or beast reduced to 0 hit points by this attack dies. Its corpse rises 24 hours later as a zombie under the wight's control." }
