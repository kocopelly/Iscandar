If its form is humanoid, it is equipped with clothing and a weapon. While shapeshifted, its statistics are the same except that it can't use Constrict and Shielding Wing and it may gain a swim speed of 60 or lose its fly speed if appropriate to its new form. If it's a beast, it can use its bite attack. If it's a humanoid, it may make a weapon attack, which functions identically to its bite attack." }
