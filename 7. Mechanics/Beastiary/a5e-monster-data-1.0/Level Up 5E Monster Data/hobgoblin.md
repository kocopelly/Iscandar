Hobgoblins look for advantages that can be found from cover, darkness, flanking, or terrain. Hobgoblins retreat only when ordered to or when all superiors are killed and they are reduced to half their original number. Even when retreating, one hobgoblin sometimes remains behind to hold off an enemy while the others withdraw." }
