    1: { name: 'Dune Splitter', desc: 'The dragon can remain submerged in sand and gravel for up to 4 hours. It has advantage on Stealth checks made to hide in this way, and Large or smaller creatures within 20 feet of its hiding place when it emerges must succeed on a DC 24 Dexterity saving throw or be blinded until the end of its next turn.' }
    2: { name: 'Legendary Resistance (3/Day)', desc: 'When the dragon fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead. When it does, it sheds some of its scales, which turn to sand. If it has no more uses of this ability, its Armor Class is reduced to 20 until it finishes a long rest.' }
    3: { name: 'High Voltage (1/Day)', desc: "When the dragon is first bloodied, it immediately recharges its breath weapon, if it's not already available. After doing so, the air around it becomes electrically charged. A creature that starts its turn within 15 feet of the dragon or moves within 15 feet of it for the first time on a turn makes a DC 24 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, it takes 11 (2d10) lightning damage and can't take reactions until the start of its next turn. Creatures in metal armor or wielding metal weapons have disadvantage on this saving throw." }

    - { name: 'Arc Lightning', desc: "The dragon targets a creature within 60 feet, forcing it to make a DC 24 Dexterity saving throw. The creature takes 22 (4d10) lightning damage on a failure or half damage on a success. Also on a failure, the lightning jumps. Choose a creature within 30 feet of the target that hasn't been hit by this ability on this turn, and repeat the effect against it, possibly causing the lightning to jump again." }
    - { name: 'Lightning Breath (Recharge 5Â–6)', desc: "The dragon exhales a 120-foot-long, 10-foot-wide line of lightning. Each creature in that area makes a DC 24 Dexterity saving throw, taking 94 (17d10) lightning damage on a failed save or half damage on a success. A creature that fails the save can't take reactions until the end of its next turn." }

Creatures within 30 feet make a DC 24 Strength saving throw, taking 22 (4d10) bludgeoning damage and falling prone on a failure.

    1: { name: Roar, desc: "Each creature of the dragon's choice within 120 feet that can hear it makes a DC 21 Charisma saving throw. On a failure, it is frightened for 1 minute. A creature repeats the saving throw at the end of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. When it succeeds on a saving throw or the effect ends for it, it is immune to Roar for 24 hours." }
    2: { name: 'Wing Attack', desc: 'The dragon beats its wings. Each creature within 15 feet makes a DC 24 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, it is pushed 10 feet away and knocked prone. The dragon can then fly up to half its fly speed.' }

    - { name: 'When fighting in the open, dragons often circle above their enemies as they wait for their breath weapons to recharge', desc: "They only close to melee if their enemies deal significant damage with ranged attacks, or if they can savage an enemy cut off from its allies. Once bloodied, dragons become more aggressive, attacking with bite and claws when their breath weapons aren't available." }
    - { name: 'If a dragon is protecting its lair, it utilizes lair features, traps, allies, and architecture such as escape tunnels to keep up a hit-and-run fight, reappearing only when it has a fully-recharged breath weapon', desc: 'If the dragon is forced into melee combat, it uses its bite and claws against a single foe. If it has legendary actions like Roar and Wing Attack, it uses them to disperse its other enemies.' }
