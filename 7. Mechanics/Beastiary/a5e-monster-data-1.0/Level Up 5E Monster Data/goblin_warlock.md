    - { name: 'Clinging Illusion', desc: 'The warlock creates a magical illusion of an unmoving Medium or smaller object in a space it can see within 30 feet. The illusion can hide a smaller object in the same space. The illusion lasts 24 hours, until a creature touches it, or until the warlock uses Clinging Illusion again. A creature can take an action to make a DC 12 Investigation check to disbelieve the illusion. On a success, the illusion appears transparent to the creature.' }

    - { name: 'Quick Switch', desc: 'When the warlock is hit by an attack, it magically teleports, switching places with a goblin ally within 30 feet. The goblin ally is hit by the triggering attack and suffers its effects.' }
combat:
    - { name: 'Goblins attack only when they outnumber their opponents', desc: 'They employ ambush, firing arrows from hiding and then using Nimble Escape to hide elsewhere. When they can, they turn an aspect of the battle to their advantage, attacking in darkness or from above or amongst traps and hazards. If a goblin is engaged in melee while not in an advantageous position, it attacks with its shortsword and then disengages. Unless a powerful leader forces them to stand their ground, goblins retreat once they no longer outnumber their enemy.' }
