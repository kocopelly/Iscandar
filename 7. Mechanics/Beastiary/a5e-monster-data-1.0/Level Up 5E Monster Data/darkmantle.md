Darkvision and natural light can't penetrate it. If the darkness overlaps with an area of light created by a 2nd-level spell or lower, the spell creating the light is dispelled. The darkness aura lasts for 10 minutes or until the darkmantle takes damage." }

If the darkmantle made the attack with advantage, it attaches to the target's head, and the target is blinded and can't breathe. While grappling, the darkmantle can only attack the grappled creature but has advantage on its attack roll. The darkmantle's speed becomes 0, and it moves with its target." }
