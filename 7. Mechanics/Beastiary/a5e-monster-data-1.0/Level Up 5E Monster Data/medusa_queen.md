traits:
    - { name: 'Petrifying Gaze', desc: "When a creature starts its turn within 60 feet of the medusa and can see the medusa's eyes, it can choose to shut its eyes until the beginning of its next turn unless it is surprised or incapacitated. Otherwise, the medusa uses its petrifying gaze on the creature. If the medusa sees its own reflection and doesn't shut its eyes, it is subject to its own gaze." }
    - { name: "A creature subject to the medusa's petrifying gaze makes a DC 14 Constitution saving throw", desc: 'If it rolls a natural 1 on the save, it is petrified instantly. If it otherwise fails the save, it is restrained as it begins to be petrified. The creature repeats the saving throw at the end of its turn, ending the effect on itself on a success and becoming petrified on a failure. The petrification can be removed with greater restoration or similar powerful magic.' }

    - { name: Multiattack, desc: 'The medusa makes any combination of two attacks with its snake hair and longbow.' }

    - { name: 'Imperious Command', desc: 'A creature with averted or covered eyes within 60 feet that can hear the medusa makes a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, it looks at the medusa, making itself the target of Petrifying Gaze if it and the medusa can see each other. On a success, the creature is immune to Imperious Command for 24 hours. This is a charm effect.' }
combat:
    - { name: "The medusa ambushes (or otherwise reveals its eyes suddenly) so its opponents can't avert their gaze", desc: 'It makes melee attacks against creatures with averted eyes. When bloodied, it hides if possible, setting up further ambushes.' }
