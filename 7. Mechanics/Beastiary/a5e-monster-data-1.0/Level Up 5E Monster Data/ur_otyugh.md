On a success, the target takes half damage." }

On a failure, the target contracts a disease. While diseased, the target is poisoned. The target repeats the saving throw every 24 hours, reducing its hit point maximum by 5 (1d10) on a failure (to a minimum of 1 hit point) and becoming cured on a success. The reduction in hit points lasts until the disease is cured.' }
