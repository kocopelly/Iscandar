actions:
    - { name: 'Darken Light', desc: 'The demon magically targets a nonmagical flame or an area of magical light created by a 2nd-level or lower spell slot within 60 feet. Any area of bright light created by the light source instead casts dim light for 10 minutes.' }
    - { name: 'Replace Shadow', desc: "The demon targets a humanoid within 5 feet that is in dim light and can't see the demon. The target makes a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a success, the target is aware of the demon. On a failure, the target is unaware of the demon, the target no longer casts a natural shadow, and the demon magically takes on the shape of the target's shadow, appearing indistinguishable from a natural shadow except when it attacks. The demon shares the target's space and moves with the target. When the demon is dealt damage while sharing the target's space, it takes half the damage (rounded down) and the other half is dealt to the target. The effect ends when the target drops to 0 hit points, the demon no longer shares the target's space, the demon or target is affected by dispel evil and good or a similar effect, or the demon begins its turn in an area of sunlight." }

Once it has done so, it may use its claws immediately, or it may travel with its victim for some time before it attacks. If it's unable to use Replace Shadow, it tries to attack from hiding. It flees if dealt radiant damage." }
