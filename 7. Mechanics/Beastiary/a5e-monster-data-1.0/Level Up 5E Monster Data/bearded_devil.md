    - { name: Glaive, desc: 'Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 8 (1d10 + 3) slashing damage. If the target is a creature other than an undead or construct, it makes a DC 12 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, it receives an infernal wound and takes 5 (1d10) ongoing slashing damage. Each time the devil hits the wounded target with this attack, the ongoing damage increases by 5 (1d10). A creature can spend an action to make a DC 12 Medicine check, ending the ongoing damage on a success. At least 1 hit point of magical healing also ends the ongoing damage.' }

Bearded devils have no ranged attacks and try to close to melee range as quickly as possible, using cover when possible. Bearded devils never flee while within sight of an ally; however, they may tactically retreat to defensible positions.' }
