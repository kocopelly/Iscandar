    - { name: 'Beast Form', desc: "The druid magically transforms into a Large or smaller beast or back into their true form. While in beast form, they retain their game statistics, can't cast spells, and can't speak. The druid's Speed increases by 10 feet, and when appropriate to their beast form they gain climb, fly, or swim speeds of 40 feet. Any equipment the druid is wearing or wielding merges into their new form." }

Each creature in the area when the spell is cast makes a DC 12 Strength saving throw. On a failure, it is restrained by vines. A creature restrained in this way can use its action to make a Strength check (DC 12), freeing itself on a success.' }
    - { name: 'Thunderwave (1st-Level; V, S)', desc: 'Thunder rolls from the druid in a 15-foot cube. Each creature in the area makes a DC 12 Constitution saving throw.

    - { name: 'Some druids live in the wilderness with only the beasts and trees for companions', desc: 'Others serve as spiritual leaders for nomads or farmers, healing the sick and praying for fortunate weather.' }
