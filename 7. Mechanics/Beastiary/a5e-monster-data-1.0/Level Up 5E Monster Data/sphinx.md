A spell ends if it was cast with a 3rd-level or lower spell slot.

When the effect ends, the creatures reappear in their original locations, along with any items they acquired on their jaunt. While the effect lasts, the sphinx can communicate telepathically with the targets. The sphinx chooses one of the following destinations:' }

combat:
    - { name: 'The sphinx uses Planar Jaunt to banish its foes if it can', desc: "Otherwise, it uses its action to cast Flame Strike on the first turn of combat and then uses its claws on successive turns. It speeds time for itself as soon as it's bloodied. With its legendary action, the sphinx attacks with its claw if it can reach an enemy or uses Teleport if it can't, and then uses Slow Time with its remaining legendary action each turn. The sphinx doesn't retreat." }
