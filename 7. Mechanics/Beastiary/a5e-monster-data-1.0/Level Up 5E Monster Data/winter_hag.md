    - { name: 'Ice Bolt', desc: "Ranged Spell Attack: +7 to hit, range 60 ft., one creature. Hit: 15 (2d10 + 4) cold damage, and the target makes a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. A creature under the hag's curse automatically fails this saving throw. On a failure, the creature is restrained as it begins to turn to ice. At the end of the creature's next turn, the creature repeats the saving throw. On a success, the effect ends. On a failure, the creature is petrified into ice. This petrification can be removed with greater restoration or similar magic." }
    - { name: Shapeshift, desc: "The hag magically polymorphs into a Small or Medium humanoid or back into its true form. Its statistics are the same in each form. Equipment it is carrying isn't transformed. It retains a streak of white hair in any form. It returns to its true form if it dies." }

combat:
    - { name: 'If the hag has allies to protect it, it uses Ice Bolt from a distance', desc: 'If alone, it attacks melee combatants with its claws while using Ice Bolt against a ranged attacker. When the hag is reduced to 40 hit points or fewer, it turns invisible and tries to escape.' }
