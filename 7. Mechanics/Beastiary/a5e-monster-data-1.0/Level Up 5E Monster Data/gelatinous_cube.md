    - { name: Engulf, desc: "The cube moves up to its Speed. While doing so, it can enter Large or smaller creatures' spaces. Whenever the cube enters a creature's space, the creature makes a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw. If the creature is unaware of the cube's presence, it makes its saving throw against Engulf with disadvantage. On a success, the creature may use its reaction, if available, to move up to half its Speed without provoking opportunity attacks. If the creature doesn't move, it is engulfed by the cube." }

It moves with the cube. The cube can hold as many creatures as fit in its space without squeezing.' }
    - { name: 'An engulfed creature can escape by using an action to make a DC 13 Strength check', desc: 'On a success, the creature moves to a space within 5 feet of the cube. A creature within 5 feet can take the same action to free an engulfed creature, but takes 10 (3d6) acid damage in the process.' }
combat:
    - { name: 'The cube moves constantly, stopping only when its blindsight detects moving creatures', desc: "It then waits motionless for creatures to blunder into it. It pursues creatures that move away from it, either Dashing or using the extra movement from its Engulf action. It retreats only if it's full (containing four Medium creatures or one Large creature) or if it's exposed to sunlight." }
