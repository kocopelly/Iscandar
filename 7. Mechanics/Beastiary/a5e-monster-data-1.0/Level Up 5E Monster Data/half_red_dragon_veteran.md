Each creature in that area makes a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 24 (7d6) fire damage on a failed save or half damage on a success. A creature who fails the saving throw also suffers 5 (1d10) ongoing fire damage. At the end of each of its turns, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the ongoing damage on a success. This fire can also be put out in typical ways, such as immersion in water, and a creature who uses an action to drop prone can put out the fire with a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw.' }
