combat:
    - { name: 'Goblins attack only when they outnumber their opponents', desc: 'They employ ambush, firing arrows from hiding and then using Nimble Escape to hide elsewhere. When they can, they turn an aspect of the battle to their advantage, attacking in darkness or from above or amongst traps and hazards. If a goblin is engaged in melee while not in an advantageous position, it attacks with its shortsword and then disengages. Unless a powerful leader forces them to stand their ground, goblins retreat once they no longer outnumber their enemy.' }
