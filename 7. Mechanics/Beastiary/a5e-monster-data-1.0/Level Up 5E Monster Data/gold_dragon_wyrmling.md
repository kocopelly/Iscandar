    - { name: 'Molten Breath', desc: 'The dragon exhales molten gold in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in the area makes a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking 22 (4d10) fire damage on a failed save or half damage on a success.' }
    - { name: 'Slowing Breath', desc: 'The dragon exhales gas in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in the area must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or suffer disadvantage on weapon attack rolls for 1 minute. A weakened creature repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success.' }
combat:
    - { name: 'While individual dragons have their own personalities and tactics, most rely heavily on their breath weapons', desc: 'They use them whenever they can, preferably from maximum distance and while flying above their enemies.' }
    - { name: 'When fighting in the open, dragons often circle above their enemies as they wait for their breath weapons to recharge', desc: "They only close to melee if their enemies deal significant damage with ranged attacks, or if they can savage an enemy cut off from its allies. Once bloodied, dragons become more aggressive, attacking with bite and claws when their breath weapons aren't available." }
    - { name: 'If a dragon is protecting its lair, it utilizes lair features, traps, allies, and architecture such as escape tunnels to keep up a hit-and-run fight, reappearing only when it has a fully-recharged breath weapon', desc: 'If the dragon is forced into melee combat, it uses its bite and claws against a single foe. If it has legendary actions like Roar and Wing Attack, it uses them to disperse its other enemies.' }
    - { name: 'If reduced to less than one-fourth its hit points while fighting in the open, a dragon flies away', desc: 'However, it fights to the death to defend its lair, unless it can regain the upper hand through tricks or bargains.' }
