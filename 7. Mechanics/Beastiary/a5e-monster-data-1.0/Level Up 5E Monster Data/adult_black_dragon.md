While grappling a creature, the dragon can't bite or use Acid Spit against another target." }

    - { name: 'Acid Spit', desc: 'The dragon targets a creature within 60 feet, forcing it to make a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw.

A creature can use an action to end the ongoing damage.' }
    - { name: 'Acid Breath (Recharge 5Â–6)', desc: 'The dragon exhales sizzling acid in a 60-foot-long, 5-foot-wide line.

A creature that fails the save is blinded until the end of its next turn.' }

    - { name: Darkness, desc: "The dragon creates a 20-foot-radius sphere of magical darkness originating from a point it can see within 120 feet. Darkvision can't penetrate this darkness. The darkness lasts for 1 minute or until the dragon uses this action again." }
    - { name: Roar, desc: "Each creature of the dragon's choice within 120 feet that can hear it makes a DC 17 Charisma saving throw. On a failure, it is frightened for 1 minute.

When it succeeds on a saving throw or the effect ends for it, it is immune to Roar for 24 hours." }
    - { name: 'Wing Attack', desc: 'The dragon beats its wings. Each creature within 15 feet makes a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, it is pushed 10 feet away and knocked prone. The dragon can then fly up to half its fly speed.' }
combat:

    - { name: 'When fighting in the open, dragons often circle above their enemies as they wait for their breath weapons to recharge', desc: "They only close to melee if their enemies deal significant damage with ranged attacks, or if they can savage an enemy cut off from its allies. Once bloodied, dragons become more aggressive, attacking with bite and claws when their breath weapons aren't available." }
    - { name: 'If a dragon is protecting its lair, it utilizes lair features, traps, allies, and architecture such as escape tunnels to keep up a hit-and-run fight, reappearing only when it has a fully-recharged breath weapon', desc: 'If the dragon is forced into melee combat, it uses its bite and claws against a single foe. If it has legendary actions like Roar and Wing Attack, it uses them to disperse its other enemies.' }
    - { name: 'If reduced to less than one-fourth its hit points while fighting in the open, a dragon flies away', desc: 'However, it fights to the death to defend its lair, unless it can regain the upper hand through tricks or bargains.' }
