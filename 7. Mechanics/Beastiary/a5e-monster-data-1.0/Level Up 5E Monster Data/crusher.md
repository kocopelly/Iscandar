    - { name: Crush, desc: "The crusher moves up to its Speed in a straight line. While doing so, it can attempt to enter Large or smaller creatures' spaces.

If the creature succeeds at a Strength saving throw, the crusher's movement ends for the turn. If the creature succeeds at a Dexterity saving throw, the creature may use its reaction, if available, to move up to half its Speed without provoking opportunity attacks. The first time on the crusher's turn that it enters a creature's space, the creature is knocked prone and takes 50 (10d8 + 5) bludgeoning damage. A creature is prone while in the crusher's space." }
