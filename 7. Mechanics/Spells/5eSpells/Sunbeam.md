description: "A beam of brilliant light flashes out from your hand in a 5-foot-wide,\
    \ 60-foot-long line. Each creature in the line must make a Constitution saving\
    \ throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 6d8 radiant damage and is blinded\
    \ until your next turn. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage and\
    \ isn\u2019t blinded by this spell. Undead and oozes have disadvantage on this\
    \ saving throw.\nYou can create a new line of radiance as your action on any turn\
    \ until the spell ends.\nFor the duration, a mote of brilliant radiance shines\
    \ in your hand. It sheds bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an\
    \ additional 30 feet. This light is sunlight."
