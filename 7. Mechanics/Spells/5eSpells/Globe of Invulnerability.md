description: "An immobile, faintly shimmering barrier springs into existence in a\
    \ 10-foot radius around you and remains for the duration.\nAny spell of 5th level\
    \ or lower cast from outside the barrier can\u2019t affect creatures or objects\
    \ within it, even if the spell is cast using a higher level spell slot. Such a\
    \ spell can target creatures and objects within the barrier, but the spell has\
    \ no effect on them. Similarly, the area within the barrier is excluded from the\
    \ areas affected by such spells.\n**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell\
    \ using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the barrier blocks spells of one\
    \ level higher for each slot level above 6th."
