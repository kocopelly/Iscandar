description: "This spell assaults and twists creatures\u2019 minds, spawning delusions\
    \ and provoking uncontrolled action. Each creature in a 10-foot-radius sphere\
    \ centered on a point you choose within range must succeed on a Wisdom saving\
    \ throw when you cast this spell or be affected by it.\nAn affected target can\u2019\
    t take reactions and must roll a d10 at the start of each of its turns to determine\
    \ its behavior for that turn.\n**1:** The creature uses all its movement to move\
    \ in a random direction. To determine the direction, roll a d8 and assign a direction\
    \ to each die face. The creature doesn\u2019t take an action this turn.\n**2\u2013\
    6:** The creature doesn\u2019t move or take actions this turn.\n**7\u20138:**\
    \ The creature uses its action to make a melee attack against a randomly determined\
    \ creature within its reach. If there is no creature within its reach, the creature\
    \ does nothing this turn.\n**9\u201310:** The creature can act and move normally.\n\
    At the end of each of its turns, an affected target can make a Wisdom saving throw.\
    \ If it succeeds, this effect ends for that target.\n**At Higher Levels.** When\
    \ you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the radius of\
    \ the sphere increases by 5 feet for each slot level above 4th."
