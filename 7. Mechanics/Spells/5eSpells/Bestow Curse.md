description: "You touch a creature, and that creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving\
    \ throw or become cursed for the duration of the spell. When you cast this spell,\
    \ choose the nature of the curse from the following options:\n** Choose one ability\
    \ score. While cursed, the target has disadvantage on ability checks and saving\
    \ throws made with that ability score.\n** While cursed, the target has disadvantage\
    \ on attack rolls against you.\n** While cursed, the target must make a Wisdom\
    \ saving throw at the start of each of its turns. If it fails, it wastes its action\
    \ that turn doing nothing.\n** While the target is cursed, your attacks and spells\
    \ deal an extra 1d8 necrotic damage to the target.\nA **remove curse** spell ends\
    \ this effect. At the GM\u2019s option, you may choose an alternative curse effect,\
    \ but it should be no more powerful than those described above. The GM has final\
    \ say on such a curse\u2019s effect.\n**At Higher Levels.** If you cast this spell\
    \ using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the duration is concentration, up\
    \ to 10 minutes. If you use a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the duration\
    \ is 8 hours. If you use a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the duration is\
    \ 24 hours. If you use a 9th level spell slot, the spell lasts until it is dispelled.\
    \ Using a spell slot of 5th level or higher grants a duration that doesn\u2019\
    t require concentration."
