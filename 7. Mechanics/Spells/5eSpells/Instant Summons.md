components: V, S, M (a sapphire worth 1,000 gp)
concentration: false
description: "You touch an object weighing 10 pounds or less whose longest dimension\
    \ is 6 feet or less. The spell leaves an invisible mark on its surface and invisibly\
    \ inscribes the name of the item on the sapphire you use as the material component.\
    \ Each time you cast this spell, you must use a different sapphire.\nAt any time\
    \ thereafter, you can use your action to speak the item\u2019s name and crush\
    \ the sapphire. The item instantly appears in your hand regardless of physical\
    \ or planar distances, and the spell ends.\nIf another creature is holding or\
    \ carrying the item, crushing the sapphire doesn\u2019t transport the item to\
    \ you, but instead you learn who the creature possessing the object is and roughly\
    \ where that creature is located at that moment.\n**Dispel magic** or a similar\
    \ effect successfully applied to the sapphire ends this spell\u2019s effect."
