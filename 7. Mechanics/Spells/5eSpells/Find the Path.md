description: "This spell allows you to find the shortest, most direct physical route\
    \ to a specific fixed location that you are familiar with on the same plane of\
    \ existence. If you name a destination on another plane of existence, a destination\
    \ that moves (such as a mobile fortress), or a destination that isn\u2019t specific\
    \ (such as \u201Ca green dragon\u2019s lair\u201D), the spell fails.\nFor the\
    \ duration, as long as you are on the same plane of existence as the destination,\
    \ you know how far it is and in what direction it lies. While you are traveling\
    \ there, whenever you are presented with a choice of paths along the way, you\
    \ automatically determine which path is the shortest and most direct route (but\
    \ not necessarily the safest route) to the destination."
