description: "Drawing on the deepest fears of a group of creatures, you create illusory\
    \ creatures in their minds, visible only to them. Each creature in a 30-foot-radius\
    \ sphere centered on a point of your choice within range must make a Wisdom saving\
    \ throw. On a failed save, a creature becomes frightened for the duration. The\
    \ illusion calls on the creature\u2019s deepest fears, manifesting its worst nightmares\
    \ as an implacable threat. At the end of each of the frightened creature\u2019\
    s turns, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or take 4d10 psychic damage.\
    \ On a successful save, the spell ends for that creature."
