    \ rating 1 or lower\n** Four fey creatures of challenge rating 1/2 or lower\n\
    ** Eight fey creatures of challenge rating 1/4 or lower\nA summoned creature disappears\

    \ are friendly to you and your companions. Roll initiative for the summoned creatures\
    \ as a group, which have their own turns. They obey any verbal commands that you\
    \ issue to them (no action required by you). If you don\u2019t issue any commands\
    \ to them, they defend themselves from hostile creatures, but otherwise take no\
