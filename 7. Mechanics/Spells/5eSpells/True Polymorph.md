description: "Choose one creature or nonmagical object that you can see within range.\
    \ You transform the creature into a different creature, the creature into an object,\
    \ or the object into a creature (the object must be neither worn nor carried by\
    \ another creature). The transformation lasts for the duration, or until the target\
    \ drops to 0 hit points or dies. If you concentrate on this spell for the full\
    \ duration, the transformation lasts until it is dispelled.\nThis spell has no\
    \ effect on a shapechanger or a creature with 0 hit points. An unwilling creature\
    \ can make a Wisdom saving throw, and if it succeeds, it isn\u2019t affected by\
    \ this spell.\n**Creature into Creature.** If you turn a creature into another\
    \ kind of creature, the new form can be any kind you choose whose challenge rating\
    \ is equal to or less than the target\u2019s (or its level, if the target doesn\u2019\
    t have a challenge rating). The target\u2019s game statistics, including mental\
    \ ability scores, are replaced by the statistics of the new form. It retains its\
    \ alignment and personality.\nThe target assumes the hit points of its new form,\
    \ and when it reverts to its normal form, the creature returns to the number of\
    \ hit points it had before it transformed. If it reverts as a result of dropping\
    \ to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to its normal form. As long\
    \ as the excess damage doesn\u2019t reduce the creature\u2019s normal form to\
    \ 0 hit points, it isn\u2019t knocked unconscious.\nThe creature is limited in\
    \ the actions it can perform by the nature of its new form, and it can\u2019t\
    \ speak, cast spells, or take any other action that requires hands or speech,\
    \ unless its new form is capable of such actions.\nThe target\u2019s gear melds\
    \ into the new form. The creature can\u2019t activate, use, wield, or otherwise\
    \ benefit from any of its equipment.\n**Object into Creature.** You can turn an\
    \ object into any kind of creature, as long as the creature\u2019s size is no\
    \ larger than the object\u2019s size and the creature\u2019s challenge rating\
    \ is 9 or lower. The creature is friendly to you and your companions. It acts\
    \ on each of your turns. You decide what action it takes and how it moves. The\
    \ GM has the creature\u2019s statistics and resolves all of its actions and movement.\n\
    If the spell becomes permanent, you no longer control the creature. It might remain\
    \ friendly to you, depending on how you have treated it.\n**Creature into Object.**\
    \ If you turn a creature into an object, it transforms along with whatever it\
    \ is wearing and carrying into that form. The creature\u2019s statistics become\
    \ those of the object, and the creature has no memory of time spent in this form,\
    \ after the spell ends and it returns to its normal form."
