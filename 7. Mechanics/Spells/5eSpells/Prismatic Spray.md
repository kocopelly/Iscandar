description: "Eight multicolored rays of light flash from your hand. Each ray is a\
    \ different color and has a different power and purpose. Each creature in a 60-foot\
    \ cone must make a Dexterity saving throw. For each target, roll a d8 to determine\
    \ which color ray affects it.\n** **Red.** The target takes 10d6 fire damage on\
    \ a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\n** **Orange.** The\
    \ target takes 10d6 acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a\
    \ successful one.\n** **Yellow.** The target takes 10d6 lightning damage on a\
    \ failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\n** **Green.** The\
    \ target takes 10d6 poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on\
    \ a successful one.\n** **Blue.** The target takes 10d6 cold damage on a failed\
    \ save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\n** **Indigo.** On a failed\
    \ save, the target is restrained. It must then make a Constitution saving throw\
    \ at the end of each of its turns. If it successfully saves three times, the spell\
    \ ends. If it fails its save three times, it permanently turns to stone and is\
    \ subjected to the petrified condition. The successes and failures don\u2019t\
    \ need to be consecutive; keep track of both until the target collects three of\
    \ a kind.\n** **Violet.** On a failed save, the target is blinded. It must then\
    \ make a Wisdom saving throw at the start of your next turn. A successful save\
    \ ends the blindness. If it fails that save, the creature is transported to another\
    \ plane of existence of the GM\u2019s choosing and is no longer blinded. (Typically,\
    \ a creature that is on a plane that isn\u2019t its home plane is banished home,\
    \ while other creatures are usually cast into the Astral or Ethereal planes.)\n\
    ** **Special.** The target is struck by two rays. Roll twice more, rerolling any\
    \ 8."
