description: "Three illusory duplicates of yourself appear in your space. Until the\
    \ spell ends, the duplicates move with you and mimic your actions, shifting position\
    \ so it\u2019s impossible to track which image is real. You can use your action\
    \ to dismiss the illusory duplicates.\nEach time a creature targets you with an\
    \ attack during the spell\u2019s duration, roll a d20 to determine whether the\
    \ attack instead targets one of your duplicates.\nIf you have three duplicates,\
    \ you must roll a 6 or higher to change the attack\u2019s target to a duplicate.\
    \ With two duplicates, you must roll an 8 or higher. With one duplicate, you must\
    \ roll an 11 or higher.\nA duplicate\u2019s AC equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier.\
    \ If an attack hits a duplicate, the duplicate is destroyed. A duplicate can be\
    \ destroyed only by an attack that hits it. It ignores all other damage and effects.\
    \ The spell ends when all three duplicates are destroyed.\nA creature is unaffected\
    \ by this spell if it can\u2019t see, if it relies on senses other than sight,\
    \ such as blindsight, or if it can perceive illusions as false, as with truesight."
