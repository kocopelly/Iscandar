description: "You create a 10-foot-radius, 20-foot-tall cylinder of magical energy\
    \ centered on a point on the ground that you can see within range. Glowing runes\
    \ appear wherever the cylinder intersects with the floor or other surface.\nChoose\
    \ one or more of the following types of creatures: celestials, elementals, fey,\
    \ fiends, or undead. The circle affects a creature of the chosen type in the following\
    \ ways:\n** The creature can\u2019t willingly enter the cylinder by nonmagical\
    \ means. If the creature tries to use teleportation or interplanar travel to do\
    \ so, it must first succeed on a Charisma saving throw.\n** The creature has disadvantage\
    \ on attack rolls against targets within the cylinder.\n** Targets within the\
    \ cylinder can\u2019t be charmed, frightened, or possessed by the creature.\n\
    When you cast this spell, you can elect to cause its magic to operate in the reverse\
    \ direction, preventing a creature of the specified type from leaving the cylinder\
    \ and protecting targets outside it.\n**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this\
    \ spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the duration increases by 1\
    \ hour for each slot level above 3rd."
