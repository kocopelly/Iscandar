description: "A sphere of shimmering force encloses a creature or object of Large\
    \ size or smaller within range. An unwilling creature must make a Dexterity saving\
    \ throw. On a failed save, the creature is enclosed for the duration.\nNothing\u2014\
    not physical objects, energy, or other spell effects\u2014can pass through the\
    \ barrier, in or out, though a creature in the sphere can breathe there. The sphere\
    \ is immune to all damage, and a creature or object inside can\u2019t be damaged\
    \ by attacks or effects originating from outside, nor can a creature inside the\
    \ sphere damage anything outside it.\nThe sphere is weightless and just large\
    \ enough to contain the creature or object inside. An enclosed creature can use\
    \ its action to push against the sphere\u2019s walls and thus roll the sphere\
    \ at up to half the creature\u2019s speed. Similarly, the globe can be picked\
    \ up and moved by other creatures.\nA **disintegrate** spell targeting the globe\
    \ destroys it without harming anything inside it."
