description: "A silvery beam of pale light shines down in a 5-foot- radius, 40-foot-high\
    \ cylinder centered on a point within range. Until the spell ends, dim light fills\
    \ the cylinder.\nWhen a creature enters the spell\u2019s area for the first time\
    \ on a turn or starts its turn there, it is engulfed in ghostly flames that cause\
    \ searing pain, and it must make a Constitution saving throw. It takes 2d10 radiant\
    \ damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\nA shapechanger\
    \ makes its saving throw with disadvantage. If it fails, it also instantly reverts\
    \ to its original form and can\u2019t assume a different form until it leaves\
    \ the spell\u2019s light.\nOn each of your turns after you cast this spell, you\
    \ can use an action to move the beam 60 feet in any direction.\n**At Higher Levels.**\
    \ When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage\
    \ increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 2nd."
