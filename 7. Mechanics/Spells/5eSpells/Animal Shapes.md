description: "Your magic turns others into beasts. Choose any number of willing creatures\
    \ that you can see within range. You transform each target into the form of a\
    \ Large or smaller beast with a challenge rating of 4 or lower. On subsequent\
    \ turns, you can use your action to transform affected creatures into new forms.\n\
    The transformation lasts for the duration for each target, or until the target\
    \ drops to 0 hit points or dies. You can choose a different form for each target.\
    \ A target\u2019s game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the chosen\
    \ beast, though the target retains its alignment and Intelligence, Wisdom, and\
    \ Charisma scores. The target assumes the hit points of its new form, and when\
    \ it reverts to its normal form, it returns to the number of hit points it had\
    \ before it transformed. If it reverts as a result of dropping to 0 hit points,\
    \ any excess damage carries over to its normal form. As long as the excess damage\
    \ doesn\u2019t reduce the creature\u2019s normal form to 0 hit points, it isn\u2019\
    t knocked unconscious. The creature is limited in the actions it can perform by\
    \ the nature of its new form, and it can\u2019t speak or cast spells.\nThe target\u2019\
    s gear melds into the new form. The target can\u2019t activate, wield, or otherwise\
    \ benefit from any of its equipment."
