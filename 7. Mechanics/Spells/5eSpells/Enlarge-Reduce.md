description: "You cause a creature or an object you can see within range to grow larger\
    \ or smaller for the duration. Choose either a creature or an object that is neither\
    \ worn nor carried. If the target is unwilling, it can make a Constitution saving\
    \ throw. On a success, the spell has no effect.\nIf the target is a creature,\
    \ everything it is wearing and carrying changes size with it. Any item dropped\
    \ by an affected creature returns to normal size at once.\n**Enlarge.** The target\u2019\
    s size doubles in all dimensions, and its weight is multiplied by eight. This\
    \ growth increases its size by one category\u2014 from Medium to Large, for example.\
    \ If there isn\u2019t enough room for the target to double its size, the creature\
    \ or object attains the maximum possible size in the space available. Until the\
    \ spell ends, the target also has advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving\
    \ throws. The target\u2019s weapons also grow to match its new size. While these\
    \ weapons are enlarged, the target\u2019s attacks with them deal 1d4 extra damage.\n\
    **Reduce.** The target\u2019s size is halved in all dimensions, and its weight\
    \ is reduced to one-eighth of normal. This reduction decreases its size by one\
    \ category\u2014from Medium to Small, for example. Until the spell ends, the target\
    \ also has disadvantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws. The target\u2019\
    s weapons also shrink to match its new size. While these weapons are reduced,\
    \ the target\u2019s attacks with them deal 1d4 less damage (this can\u2019t reduce\
    \ the damage below 1)."
