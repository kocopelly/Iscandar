description: "You attempt to turn one creature that you can see within range into\
    \ stone. If the target\u2019s body is made of flesh, the creature must make a\
    \ Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it is restrained as its flesh begins\
    \ to harden. On a successful save, the creature isn\u2019t affected.\nA creature\
    \ restrained by this spell must make another Constitution saving throw at the\
    \ end of each of its turns. If it successfully saves against this spell three\
    \ times, the spell ends. If it fails its saves three times, it is turned to stone\
    \ and subjected to the petrified condition for the duration. The successes and\
    \ failures don\u2019t need to be consecutive; keep track of both until the target\
    \ collects three of a kind.\nIf the creature is physically broken while petrified,\
    \ it suffers from similar deformities if it reverts to its original state.\nIf\
    \ you maintain your concentration on this spell for the entire possible duration,\
    \ the creature is turned to stone until the effect is removed."
