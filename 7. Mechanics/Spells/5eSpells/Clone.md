- Wizard
components: V, S, M (a diamond worth at least 1,000 gp and at least 1 cubic inch of

    worth at least 2,000 gp that has a sealable lid and is large enough to hold a

description: "This spell grows an inert duplicate of a living creature as a safeguard\
    \ against death. This clone forms inside a sealed vessel and grows to full size\
    \ and maturity after 120 days; you can also choose to have the clone be a younger\
    \ version of the same creature. It remains inert and endures indefinitely, as\
    \ long as its vessel remains undisturbed.\nAt any time after the clone matures,\
    \ if the original creature dies, its soul transfers to the clone, provided that\
    \ the soul is free and willing to return.\nThe clone is physically identical to\
    \ the original and has the same personality, memories, and abilities, but none\
    \ of the original\u2019s equipment. The original creature\u2019s physical remains,\
    \ if they still exist, become inert and can\u2019t thereafter be restored to life,\
    \ since the creature\u2019s soul is elsewhere."
