description: "Your touch inflicts disease. Make a melee spell attack against a creature\
    \ within your reach. On a hit, you afflict the creature with a disease of your\
    \ choice from any of the ones described below.\nAt the end of each of the target\u2019\
    s turns, it must make a Constitution saving throw. After failing three of these\
    \ saving throws, the disease\u2019s effects last for the duration, and the creature\
    \ stops making these saves. After succeeding on three of these saving throws,\
    \ the creature recovers from the disease, and the spell ends.\nSince this spell\
    \ induces a natural disease in its target, any effect that removes a disease or\
    \ otherwise ameliorates a disease\u2019s effects apply to it.\n**Blinding Sickness.**\
    \ Pain grips the creature\u2019s mind, and its eyes turn milky white. The creature\
    \ has disadvantage on Wisdom checks and Wisdom saving throws and is blinded.\n\
    **Filth Fever.** A raging fever sweeps through the creature\u2019s body. The creature\
    \ has disadvantage on Strength checks, Strength saving throws, and attack rolls\
    \ that use Strength.\n**Flesh Rot.** The creature\u2019s flesh decays. The creature\
    \ has disadvantage on Charisma checks and vulnerability to all damage.\n**Mindfire.**\
    \ The creature\u2019s mind becomes feverish. The creature has disadvantage on\
    \ Intelligence checks and Intelligence saving throws, and the creature behaves\
    \ as if under the effects of the **confusion** spell during combat.\n**Seizure.**\
    \ The creature is overcome with shaking. The creature has disadvantage on Dexterity\
    \ checks, Dexterity saving throws, and attack rolls that use Dexterity.\n**Slimy\
    \ Doom.** The creature begins to bleed uncontrollably. The creature has disadvantage\
    \ on Constitution checks and Constitution saving throws. In addition, whenever\
    \ the creature takes damage, it is stunned until the end of its next turn."
