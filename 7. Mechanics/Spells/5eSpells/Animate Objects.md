description: "Objects come to life at your command. Choose up to ten nonmagical objects\
    \ within range that are not being worn or carried. Medium targets count as two\
    \ objects, Large targets count as four objects, Huge targets count as eight objects.\
    \ You can\u2019t animate any object larger than Huge. Each target animates and\
    \ becomes a creature under your control until the spell ends or until reduced\
    \ to 0 hit points.\nAs a bonus action, you can mentally command any creature you\
    \ made with this spell if the creature is within 500 feet of you (if you control\
    \ multiple creatures, you can command any or all of them at the same time, issuing\
    \ the same command to each one). You decide what action the creature will take\
    \ and where it will move during its next turn, or you can issue a general command,\
    \ such as to guard a particular chamber or corridor. If you issue no commands,\
    \ the creature only defends itself against hostile creatures. Once given an order,\
    \ the creature continues to follow it until its task is complete."
