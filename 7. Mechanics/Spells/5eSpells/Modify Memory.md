description: "You attempt to reshape another creature\u2019s memories. One creature\
    \ that you can see must make a Wisdom saving throw. If you are fighting the creature,\
    \ it has advantage on the saving throw. On a failed save, the target becomes charmed\
    \ by you for the duration. The charmed target is incapacitated and unaware of\
    \ its surroundings, though it can still hear you. If it takes any damage or is\
    \ targeted by another spell, this spell ends, and none of the target\u2019s memories\
    \ are modified.\nWhile this charm lasts, you can affect the target\u2019s memory\
    \ of an event that it experienced within the last 24 hours and that lasted no\
    \ more than 10 minutes. You can permanently eliminate all memory of the event,\
    \ allow the target to recall the event with perfect clarity and exacting detail,\
    \ change its memory of the details of the event, or create a memory of some other\
    \ event.\nYou must speak to the target to describe how its memories are affected,\
    \ and it must be able to understand your language for the modified memories to\
    \ take root. Its mind fills in any gaps in the details of your description. If\
    \ the spell ends before you have finished describing the modified memories, the\
    \ creature\u2019s memory isn\u2019t altered. Otherwise, the modified memories\
    \ take hold when the spell ends.\nA modified memory doesn\u2019t necessarily affect\
    \ how a creature behaves, particularly if the memory contradicts the creature\u2019\
    s natural inclinations, alignment, or beliefs. An illogical modified memory, such\
    \ as implanting a memory of how much the creature enjoyed dousing itself in acid,\
    \ is dismissed, perhaps as a bad dream. The GM might deem a modified memory too\
    \ nonsensical to affect a creature in a significant manner.\nA **remove curse**\
    \ or **greater restoration** spell cast on the target restores the creature\u2019\
    s true memory.\n**At Higher Levels**. If you cast this spell using a spell slot\
    \ of 6th level or higher, you can alter the target\u2019s memories of an event\
    \ that took place up to 7 days ago (6th level), 30 days ago (7th level), 1 year\
    \ ago (8th level), or any time in the creature\u2019s past (9th level)."
