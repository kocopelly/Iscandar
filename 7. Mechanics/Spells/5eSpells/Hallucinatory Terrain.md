description: "You make natural terrain in a 150-foot cube in range look, sound, and\
    \ smell like some other sort of natural terrain. Thus, open fields or a road can\
    \ be made to resemble a swamp, hill, crevasse, or some other difficult or impassable\
    \ terrain. A pond can be made to seem like a grassy meadow, a precipice like a\
    \ gentle slope, or a rock-strewn gully like a wide and smooth road. Manufactured\
    \ structures, equipment, and creatures within the area aren\u2019t changed in\
    \ appearance.\nThe tactile characteristics of the terrain are unchanged, so creatures\
    \ entering the area are likely to see through the illusion. If the difference\
    \ isn\u2019t obvious by touch, a creature carefully examining the illusion can\
    \ attempt an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC to\
    \ disbelieve it. A creature who discerns the illusion for what it is, sees it\
    \ as a vague image superimposed on the terrain."
