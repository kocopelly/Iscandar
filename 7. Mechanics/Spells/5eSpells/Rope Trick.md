description: "You touch a length of rope that is up to 60 feet long. One end of the\
    \ rope then rises into the air until the whole rope hangs perpendicular to the\
    \ ground. At the upper end of the rope, an invisible entrance opens to an extradimensional\
    \ space that lasts until the spell ends.\nThe extradimensional space can be reached\
    \ by climbing to the top of the rope. The space can hold as many as eight Medium\
    \ or smaller creatures. The rope can be pulled into the space, making the rope\
    \ disappear from view outside the space.\nAttacks and spells can\u2019t cross\
    \ through the entrance into or out of the extradimensional space, but those inside\
    \ can see out of it as if through a 3-foot-by-5- foot window centered on the rope.\n\
    Anything inside the extradimensional space drops out when the spell ends."
