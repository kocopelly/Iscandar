description: "You touch a creature that has been dead for no longer than 200 years\
    \ and that died for any reason except old age. If the creature\u2019s soul is\
    \ free and willing, the creature is restored to life with all its hit points.\n\
    This spell closes all wounds, neutralizes any poison, cures all diseases, and\
    \ lifts any curses affecting the creature when it died. The spell replaces damaged\
    \ or missing organs and limbs.\nThe spell can even provide a new body if the original\
    \ no longer exists, in which case you must speak the creature\u2019s name. The\
    \ creature then appears in an unoccupied space you choose within 10 feet of you."
