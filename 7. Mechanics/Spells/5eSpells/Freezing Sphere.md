description: "A frigid globe of cold energy streaks from your fingertips to a point\
    \ of your choice within range, where it explodes in a 60-foot-radius sphere. Each\
    \ creature within the area must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed\
    \ save, a creature takes 10d6 cold damage. On a successful save, it takes half\
    \ as much damage.\nIf the globe strikes a body of water or a liquid that is principally\
    \ water (not including water-based creatures), it freezes the liquid to a depth\
    \ of 6 inches over an area 30 feet square. This ice lasts for 1 minute. Creatures\
    \ that were swimming on the surface of frozen water are trapped in the ice. A\
    \ trapped creature can use an action to make a Strength check against your spell\
    \ save DC to break free.\nYou can refrain from firing the globe after completing\
    \ the spell, if you wish. A small globe about the size of a sling stone, cool\
    \ to the touch, appears in your hand. At any time, you or a creature you give\
    \ the globe to can throw the globe (to a range of 40 feet) or hurl it with a sling\
    \ (to the sling\u2019s normal range). It shatters on impact, with the same effect\
    \ as the normal casting of the spell. You can also set the globe down without\
    \ shattering it. After 1 minute, if the globe hasn\u2019t already shattered, it\
    \ explodes.\n**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot\
    \ of 7th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above\
    \ 6th."
