description: "You convert raw materials into products of the same material. For example,\
    \ you can fabricate a wooden bridge from a clump of trees, a rope from a patch\
    \ of hemp, and clothes from flax or wool.\nChoose raw materials that you can see\
    \ within range. You can fabricate a Large or smaller object (contained within\
    \ a 10-foot cube, or eight connected 5-foot cubes), given a sufficient quantity\
    \ of raw material. If you are working with metal, stone, or another mineral substance,\
    \ however, the fabricated object can be no larger than Medium (contained within\
    \ a single 5-foot cube). The quality of objects made by the spell is commensurate\
    \ with the quality of the raw materials.\nCreatures or magic items can\u2019t\
    \ be created or transmuted by this spell. You also can\u2019t use it to create\
    \ items that ordinarily require a high degree of craftsmanship, such as jewelry,\
    \ weapons, glass, or armor, unless you have proficiency with the type of artisan\u2019\
    s tools used to craft such objects."
