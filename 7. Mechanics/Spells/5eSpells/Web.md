description: "You conjure a mass of thick, sticky webbing at a point of your choice\
    \ within range. The webs fill a 20- foot cube from that point for the duration.\
    \ The webs are difficult terrain and lightly obscure their area.\nIf the webs\
    \ aren\u2019t anchored between two solid masses (such as walls or trees) or layered\
    \ across a floor, wall, or ceiling, the conjured web collapses on itself, and\
    \ the spell ends at the start of your next turn. Webs layered over a flat surface\
    \ have a depth of 5 feet.\nEach creature that starts its turn in the webs or that\
    \ enters them during its turn must make a\nDexterity saving throw. On a failed\
    \ save, the creature is restrained as long as it remains in the webs or until\
    \ it breaks free.\nA creature restrained by the webs can use its action to make\
    \ a Strength check against your spell save DC. If it succeeds, it is no longer\
    \ restrained.\nThe webs are flammable. Any 5-foot cube of webs exposed to fire\
    \ burns away in 1 round, dealing 2d4 fire damage to any creature that starts its\
    \ turn in the fire."
