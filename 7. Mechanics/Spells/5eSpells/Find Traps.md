description: "You sense the presence of any trap within range that is within line\
    \ of sight. A trap, for the purpose of this spell, includes anything that would\
    \ inflict a sudden or unexpected effect you consider harmful or undesirable, which\
    \ was specifically intended as such by its creator. Thus, the spell would sense\
    \ an area affected by the **alarm** spell, a **glyph of warding**, or a mechanical\
    \ pit trap, but it would not reveal a natural weakness in the floor, an unstable\
    \ ceiling, or a hidden sinkhole.\nThis spell merely reveals that a trap is present.\n\
    You don\u2019t learn the location of each trap, but you do learn the general nature\
    \ of the danger posed by a trap you sense."
