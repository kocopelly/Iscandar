description: "You make yourself\u2014including your clothing, armor, weapons, and\
    \ other belongings on your person\u2014 look different until the spell ends or\
    \ until you use your action to dismiss it. You can seem 1 foot shorter or taller\
    \ and can appear thin, fat, or in between. You can\u2019t change your body type,\
    \ so you must adopt a form that has the same basic arrangement of limbs. Otherwise,\
    \ the extent of the illusion is up to you.\nThe changes wrought by this spell\
    \ fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, if you use this spell to\
    \ add a hat to your outfit, objects pass through the hat, and anyone who touches\
    \ it would feel nothing or would feel your head and hair. If you use this spell\
    \ to appear thinner than you are, the hand of someone who reaches out to touch\
    \ you would bump into you while it was seemingly still in midair.\nTo discern\
    \ that you are disguised, a creature can use its action to inspect your appearance\
    \ and must succeed on an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell\
    \ save DC."
