description: "This spell instantly transports you and up to eight willing creatures\
    \ of your choice that you can see within range, or a single object that you can\
    \ see within range, to a destination you select. If you target an object, it must\
    \ be able to fit entirely inside a 10-foot cube, and it can\u2019t be held or\
    \ carried by an unwilling creature.\nThe destination you choose must be known\
    \ to you, and it must be on the same plane of existence as you. Your familiarity\
    \ with the destination determines whether you arrive there successfully. The GM\
    \ rolls d100 and consults the table.\n**Permanent circle:** \u2014:** \u2014:**\
    \ \u2014:** 01\u2013100\n**Associated object:** \u2014:** \u2014:** \u2014:**\
    \ 01\u2013100\n**Very familiar:** 01\u201305:** 06\u201313:** 14\u201324:** 25\u2013\
    100\n**Seen casually:** 01\u201333:** 34\u201343:** 44\u201353:** 54\u2013100\n\
    **Viewed once:** 01\u201343:** 44\u201353:** 54\u201373:** 74\u2013100\n**Description:**\
    \ 01\u201343:** 44\u201353:** 54\u201373:** 74\u2013100\n**False destination:**\
    \ 01\u201350:** 51\u2013100:** \u2014:** \u2014\n**Familiarity.** \u201CPermanent\
    \ circle\u201D means a permanent teleportation circle whose sigil sequence you\
    \ know. \u201CAssociated object\u201D means that you possess an object taken from\
    \ the desired destination within the last six months, such as a book from a wizard\u2019\
    s library, bed linen from a royal suite, or a chunk of marble from a lich\u2019\
    s secret tomb.\n\u201CVery familiar\u201D is a place you have been very often,\
    \ a place you have carefully studied, or a place you can see when you cast the\
    \ spell. \u201CSeen casually\u201D is someplace you have seen more than once but\
    \ with which you aren\u2019t very familiar. \u201CViewed once\u201D is a place\
    \ you have seen once, possibly using magic. \u201CDescription\u201D is a place\
    \ whose location and appearance you know through someone else\u2019s description,\
    \ perhaps from a map.\n\u201CFalse destination\u201D is a place that doesn\u2019\
    t exist. Perhaps you tried to scry an enemy\u2019s sanctum but instead viewed\
    \ an illusion, or you are attempting to teleport to a familiar location that no\
    \ longer exists.\n**On Target.** You and your group (or the target object) appear\
    \ where you want to.\n**Off Target.** You and your group (or the target object)\
    \ appear a random distance away from the destination in a random direction. Distance\
    \ off target is 1d10 \xD7 1d10 percent of the distance that was to be traveled.\
    \ For example, if you tried to travel 120 miles, landed off target, and rolled\
    \ a 5 and 3 on the two d10s, then you would be off target by 15 percent, or 18\
    \ miles. The GM determines the direction off target randomly by rolling a d8 and\
    \ designating 1 as north, 2 as northeast, 3 as east, and so on around the points\
    \ of the compass. If you were teleporting to a coastal city and wound up 18 miles\
    \ out at sea, you could be in trouble.\n**Similar Area.** You and your group (or\
    \ the target object) wind up in a different area that\u2019s visually or thematically\
    \ similar to the target area. If you are heading for your home laboratory, for\
    \ example, you might wind up in another wizard\u2019s laboratory or in an alchemical\
    \ supply shop that has many of the same tools and implements as your laboratory.\
    \ Generally, you appear in the closest similar place, but since the spell has\
    \ no range limit, you could conceivably wind up anywhere on the plane.\n**Mishap.**\
    \ The spell\u2019s unpredictable magic results in a difficult journey. Each teleporting\
    \ creature (or the target object) takes 3d10 force damage, and the GM rerolls\
    \ on the table to see where you wind up (multiple mishaps can occur, dealing damage\
    \ each time)."
