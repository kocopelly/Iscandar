description: "A flickering flame appears in your hand. The flame remains there for\
    \ the duration and harms neither you nor your equipment. The flame sheds bright\
    \ light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. The spell\
    \ ends if you dismiss it as an action or if you cast it again.\nYou can also attack\
    \ with the flame, although doing so ends the spell. When you cast this spell,\
    \ or as an action on a later turn, you can hurl the flame at a creature within\
    \ 30 feet of you. Make a ranged spell attack. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 fire\
    \ damage.\nThis spell\u2019s damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level\
    \ (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8)."
