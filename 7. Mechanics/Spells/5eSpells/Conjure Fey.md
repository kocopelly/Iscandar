description: "You summon a fey creature of challenge rating 6 or lower, or a fey spirit\
    \ that takes the form of a beast of challenge rating 6 or lower. It appears in\
    \ an unoccupied space that you can see within range. The fey creature disappears\
    \ when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends.\nThe fey creature is friendly\
    \ to you and your companions for the duration. Roll initiative for the creature,\
    \ which has its own turns. It obeys any verbal commands that you issue to it (no\
    \ action required by you), as long as they don\u2019t violate its alignment. If\
    \ you don\u2019t issue any commands to the fey creature, it defends itself from\
    \ hostile creatures but otherwise takes no actions.\nIf your concentration is\
    \ broken, the fey creature doesn\u2019t disappear. Instead, you lose control of\
    \ the fey creature, it becomes hostile toward you and your companions, and it\
    \ might attack. An uncontrolled fey creature can\u2019t be dismissed by you, and\
    \ it disappears 1 hour after you summoned it.\nThe GM has the fey creature\u2019\
    s statistics.\n**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot\
    \ of 7th level or higher, the challenge rating increases by 1 for each slot level\
    \ above 6th."
