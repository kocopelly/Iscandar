description: "You summon elementals that appear in unoccupied spaces that you can\
    \ see within range. You choose one the following options for what appears:\n**\
    \ One elemental of challenge rating 2 or lower\n** Two elementals of challenge\
    \ rating 1 or lower\n** Four elementals of challenge rating 1/2 or lower\n** Eight\
    \ elementals of challenge rating 1/4 or lower. An elemental summoned by this spell\
    \ disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends.\nThe summoned\
    \ creatures are friendly to you and your companions. Roll initiative for the summoned\
    \ creatures as a group, which has its own turns. They obey any verbal commands\
    \ that you issue to them (no action required by you). If you don\u2019t issue\
    \ any commands to them, they defend themselves from hostile creatures, but otherwise\
    \ take no actions.\nThe GM has the creatures\u2019 statistics.\n**At Higher Levels.**\
    \ When you cast this spell using certain higher-level spell slots, you choose\
    \ one of the summoning options above, and more creatures appear: twice as many\
    \ with a 6th-level slot and three times as many with an 8th-level slot."
