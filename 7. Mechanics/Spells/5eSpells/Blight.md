description: "Necromantic energy washes over a creature of your choice that you can\
    \ see within range, draining moisture and vitality from it. The target must make\
    \ a Constitution saving throw. The target takes 8d8 necrotic damage on a failed\
    \ save, or half as much damage on a successful one. This spell has no effect on\
    \ undead or constructs.\nIf you target a plant creature or a magical plant, it\
    \ makes the saving throw with disadvantage, and the spell deals maximum damage\
    \ to it.\nIf you target a nonmagical plant that isn\u2019t a creature, such as\
    \ a tree or shrub, it doesn\u2019t make a saving throw; it simply withers and\
    \ dies.\n**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of\
    \ 5th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 4th."
