description: "You summon a spirit that assumes the form of an unusually intelligent,\
    \ strong, and loyal steed, creating a long-lasting bond with it. Appearing in\
    \ an unoccupied space within range, the steed takes on a form that you choose:\
    \ a warhorse, a pony, a camel, an elk, or a mastiff. (Your GM might allow other\
    \ animals to be summoned as steeds.) The steed has the statistics of the chosen\
    \ form, though it is a celestial, fey, or fiend (your choice) instead of its normal\
    \ type. Additionally, if your steed has an Intelligence of 5 or less, its Intelligence\
    \ becomes 6, and it gains the ability to understand one language of your choice\
    \ that you speak.\nYour steed serves you as a mount, both in combat and out, and\
    \ you have an instinctive bond with it that allows you to fight as a seamless\
    \ unit. While mounted on your steed, you can make any spell you cast that targets\
    \ only you also target your steed.\nWhen the steed drops to 0 hit points, it disappears,\
    \ leaving behind no physical form. You can also dismiss your steed at any time\
    \ as an action, causing it to disappear. In either case, casting this spell again\
    \ summons the same steed, restored to its hit point maximum.\nWhile your steed\
    \ is within 1 mile of you, you can communicate with it telepathically.\nYou can\u2019\
    t have more than one steed bonded by this spell at a time. As an action, you can\
    \ release the steed from its bond at any time, causing it to disappear."
