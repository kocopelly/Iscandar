    \ in an unoccupied space that you can see within range. The celestial disappears\
    \ when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends.\nThe celestial is friendly\
    \ to you and your companions for the duration. Roll initiative for the celestial,\
    \ which has its own turns. It obeys any verbal commands that you issue to it (no\
    \ action required by you), as long as they don\u2019t violate its alignment. If\
    \ you don\u2019t issue any commands to the celestial, it defends itself from hostile\
    \ creatures but otherwise takes no actions.\nThe GM has the celestial\u2019s statistics.\n\
