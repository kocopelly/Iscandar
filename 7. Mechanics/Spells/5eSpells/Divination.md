description: "Your magic and an offering put you in contact with a god or a god\u2019\
    s servants. You ask a single question concerning a specific goal, event, or activity\
    \ to occur within 7 days. The GM offers a truthful reply. The reply might be a\
    \ short phrase, a cryptic rhyme, or an omen.\nThe spell doesn\u2019t take into\
    \ account any possible circumstances that might change the outcome, such as the\
    \ casting of additional spells or the loss or gain of a companion.\nIf you cast\
    \ the spell two or more times before finishing your next long rest, there is a\
    \ cumulative 25 percent chance for each casting after the first that you get a\
    \ random reading. The GM makes this roll in secret."
