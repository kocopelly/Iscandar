description: "One creature or object of your choice that you can see within range\
    \ rises vertically, up to 20 feet, and remains suspended there for the duration.\
    \ The spell can levitate a target that weighs up to 500 pounds. An unwilling creature\
    \ that succeeds on a Constitution saving throw is unaffected.\nThe target can\
    \ move only by pushing or pulling against a fixed object or surface within reach\
    \ (such as a wall or a ceiling), which allows it to move as if it were climbing.\
    \ You can change the target\u2019s altitude by up to 20 feet in either direction\
    \ on your turn. If you are the target, you can move up or down as part of your\
    \ move. Otherwise, you can use your action to move the target, which must remain\
    \ within the spell\u2019s range.\nWhen the spell ends, the target floats gently\
    \ to the ground if it is still aloft."
