    \ The area is heavily obscured, and exposed flames in the area are doused.\nThe\
    \ ground in the area is covered with slick ice, making it difficult terrain. When\

    \ its turn there, it must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, it\
    \ falls prone.\nIf a creature is concentrating in the spell\u2019s area, the creature\
    \ must make a successful Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC\
