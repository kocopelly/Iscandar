description: "You touch a dead creature that has been dead for no more than a century,\
    \ that didn\u2019t die of old age, and that isn\u2019t undead. If its soul is\
    \ free and willing, the target returns to life with all its hit points.\nThis\
    \ spell neutralizes any poisons and cures normal diseases afflicting the creature\
    \ when it died. It doesn\u2019t, however, remove magical diseases, curses, and\
    \ the like; if such effects aren\u2019t removed prior to casting the spell, they\
    \ afflict the target on its return to life.\nThis spell closes all mortal wounds\
    \ and restores any missing body parts.\nComing back from the dead is an ordeal.\
    \ The target takes a \u22124 penalty to all attack rolls, saving throws, and ability\
    \ checks. Every time the target finishes a long rest, the penalty is reduced by\
    \ 1 until it disappears.\nCasting this spell to restore life to a creature that\
    \ has been dead for one year or longer taxes you greatly. Until you finish a long\
    \ rest, you can\u2019t cast spells again, and you have disadvantage on all attack\
    \ rolls, ability checks, and saving throws."
