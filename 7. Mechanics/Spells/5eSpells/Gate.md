description: "You conjure a portal linking an unoccupied space you can see within\
    \ range to a precise location on a different plane of existence. The portal is\
    \ a circular opening, which you can make 5 to 20 feet in diameter. You can orient\
    \ the portal in any direction you choose. The portal lasts for the duration.\n\
    The portal has a front and a back on each plane where it appears. Travel through\
    \ the portal is possible only by moving through its front. Anything that does\
    \ so is instantly transported to the other plane, appearing in the unoccupied\
    \ space nearest to the portal.\nDeities and other planar rulers can prevent portals\
    \ created by this spell from opening in their presence or anywhere within their\
    \ domains.\nWhen you cast this spell, you can speak the name of a specific creature\
    \ (a pseudonym, title, or nickname doesn\u2019t work). If that creature is on\
    \ a plane other than the one you are on, the portal opens in the named creature\u2019\
    s immediate vicinity and draws the creature through it to the nearest unoccupied\
    \ space on your side of the portal. You gain no special power over the creature,\
    \ and it is free to act as the GM deems appropriate. It might leave, attack you,\
    \ or help you."
