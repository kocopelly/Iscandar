description: "An immobile, invisible, cube-shaped prison composed of magical force\
    \ springs into existence around an area you choose within range. The prison can\
    \ be a cage or a solid box, as you choose.\nA prison in the shape of a cage can\
    \ be up to 20 feet on a side and is made from 1/2-inch diameter bars spaced 1/2\
    \ inch apart.\nA prison in the shape of a box can be up to 10 feet on a side,\
    \ creating a solid barrier that prevents any matter from passing through it and\
    \ blocking any spells cast into or out from the area.\nWhen you cast the spell,\
    \ any creature that is completely inside the cage\u2019s area is trapped. Creatures\
    \ only partially within the area, or those too large to fit inside the area, are\
    \ pushed away from the center of the area until they are completely outside the\
    \ area.\nA creature inside the cage can\u2019t leave it by nonmagical means. If\
    \ the creature tries to use teleportation or interplanar travel to leave the cage,\
    \ it must first make a Charisma saving throw. On a success, the creature can use\
    \ that magic to exit the cage. On a failure, the creature can\u2019t exit the\
    \ cage and wastes the use of the spell or effect. The cage also extends into the\
    \ Ethereal Plane, blocking ethereal travel.\nThis spell can\u2019t be dispelled\
    \ by **dispel magic**."
