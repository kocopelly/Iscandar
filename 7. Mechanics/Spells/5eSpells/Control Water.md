description: "Until the spell ends, you control any freestanding water inside an area\
    \ you choose that is a cube up to 100 feet on a side. You can choose from any\
    \ of the following effects when you cast this spell. As an action on your turn,\
    \ you can repeat the same effect or choose a different one.\n**Flood.** You cause\
    \ the water level of all standing water in the area to rise by as much as 20 feet.\
    \ If the area includes a shore, the flooding water spills over onto dry land.\n\
    If you choose an area in a large body of water, you instead create a 20-foot tall\
    \ wave that travels from one side of the area to the other and then crashes down.\
    \ Any Huge or smaller vehicles in the wave\u2019s path are carried with it to\
    \ the other side. Any Huge or smaller vehicles struck by the wave have a 25 percent\
    \ chance of capsizing.\nThe water level remains elevated until the spell ends\
    \ or you choose a different effect. If this effect produced a wave, the wave repeats\
    \ on the start of your next turn while the flood effect lasts.\n**Part Water.**\
    \ You cause water in the area to move apart and create a trench. The trench extends\
    \ across the spell\u2019s area, and the separated water forms a wall to either\
    \ side. The trench remains until the spell ends or you choose a different effect.\
    \ The water then slowly fills in the trench over the course of the next round\
    \ until the normal water level is restored.\n**Redirect Flow.** You cause flowing\
    \ water in the area to move in a direction you choose, even if the water has to\
    \ flow over obstacles, up walls, or in other unlikely directions. The water in\
    \ the area moves as you direct it, but once it moves beyond the spell\u2019s area,\
    \ it resumes its flow based on the terrain conditions. The water continues to\
    \ move in the direction you chose until the spell ends or you choose a different\
    \ effect.\n**Whirlpool.** This effect requires a body of water at least 50 feet\
    \ square and 25 feet deep. You cause a whirlpool to form in the center of the\
    \ area. The whirlpool forms a vortex that is 5 feet wide at the base, up to 50\
    \ feet wide at the top, and 25 feet tall. Any creature or object in the water\
    \ and within 25 feet of the vortex is pulled 10 feet toward it. A creature can\
    \ swim away from the vortex by making a Strength (Athletics) check against your\
    \ spell save DC.\nWhen a creature enters the vortex for the first time on a turn\
    \ or starts its turn there, it must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed\
    \ save, the creature takes 2d8 bludgeoning damage and is caught in the vortex\
    \ until the spell ends. On a successful save, the creature takes half damage,\
    \ and isn\u2019t caught in the vortex. A creature caught in the vortex can use\
    \ its action to try to swim away from the vortex as described above, but has disadvantage\
    \ on the Strength (Athletics) check to do so.\nThe first time each turn that an\
    \ object enters the vortex, the object takes 2d8 bludgeoning damage; this damage\
    \ occurs each round it remains in the vortex."
