description: "You implant a message within an object in range, a message that is uttered\
    \ when a trigger condition is met. Choose an object that you can see and that\
    \ isn\u2019t being worn or carried by another creature. Then speak the message,\
    \ which must be 25 words or less, though it can be delivered over as long as 10\
    \ minutes. Finally, determine the circumstance that will trigger the spell to\
    \ deliver your message.\nWhen that circumstance occurs, a magical mouth appears\
    \ on the object and recites the message in your voice and at the same volume you\
    \ spoke. If the object you chose has a mouth or something that looks like a mouth\
    \ (for example, the mouth of a statue), the magical mouth appears there so that\
    \ the words appear to come from the object\u2019s mouth. When you cast this spell,\
    \ you can have the spell end after it delivers its message, or it can remain and\
    \ repeat its message whenever the trigger occurs.\nThe triggering circumstance\
    \ can be as general or as detailed as you like, though it must be based on visual\
    \ or audible conditions that occur within 30 feet of the object. For example,\
    \ you could instruct the mouth to speak when any creature moves within 30 feet\
    \ of the object or when a silver bell rings within 30 feet of it."
