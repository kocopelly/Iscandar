    \ cube originating from you must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed\
    \ save, a creature takes 2d8 thunder damage and is pushed 10 feet away from you.\
    \ On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn\u2019t\
    \ pushed.\nIn addition, unsecured objects that are completely within the area\
    \ of effect are automatically pushed 10 feet away from you by the spell\u2019\
    s effect, and the spell emits a thunderous boom audible out to 300 feet.\n**At\
    \ Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or\
    \ higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 1st."
