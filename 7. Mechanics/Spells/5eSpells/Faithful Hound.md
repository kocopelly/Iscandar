description: "You conjure a phantom watchdog in an unoccupied space that you can see\
    \ within range, where it remains for the duration, until you dismiss it as an\
    \ action, or until you move more than 100 feet away from it.\nThe hound is invisible\
    \ to all creatures except you and can\u2019t be harmed. When a Small or larger\
    \ creature comes within 30 feet of it without first speaking the password that\
    \ you specify when you cast this spell, the hound starts barking loudly. The hound\
    \ sees invisible creatures and can see into the Ethereal Plane. It ignores illusions.\n\
    At the start of each of your turns, the hound attempts to bite one creature within\
    \ 5 feet of it that is hostile to you. The hound\u2019s attack bonus is equal\
    \ to your spellcasting ability modifier + your proficiency bonus. On a hit, it\
    \ deals 4d8 piercing damage."
