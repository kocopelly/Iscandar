description: "You speak a one-word command to a creature you can see within range.\
    \ The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or follow the command on its\
    \ next turn. The spell has no effect if the target is undead, if it doesn\u2019\
    t understand your language, or if your command is directly harmful to it.\nSome\
    \ typical commands and their effects follow. You might issue a command other than\
    \ one described here. If you do so, the GM determines how the target behaves.\
    \ If the target can\u2019t follow your command, the spell ends.\n**Approach.**\
    \ The target moves toward you by the shortest and most direct route, ending its\
    \ turn if it moves within 5 feet of you.\n**Drop.** The target drops whatever\
    \ it is holding and then ends its turn.\n**Flee.** The target spends its turn\
    \ moving away from you by the fastest available means.\n**Grovel.** The target\
    \ falls prone and then ends its turn.\n**Halt.** The target doesn\u2019t move\
    \ and takes no actions.\nA flying creature stays aloft, provided that it is able\
    \ to do so. If it must move to stay aloft, it flies the minimum distance needed\
    \ to remain in the air.\n**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using\
    \ a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you can affect one additional creature\
    \ for each slot level above 1st. The creatures must be within 30 feet of each\
    \ other when you target them."
