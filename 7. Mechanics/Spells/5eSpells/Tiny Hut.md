description: "A 10-foot-radius immobile dome of force springs into existence around\
    \ and above you and remains stationary for the duration. The spell ends if you\
    \ leave its area.\nNine creatures of Medium size or smaller can fit inside the\
    \ dome with you. The spell fails if its area includes a larger creature or more\
    \ than nine creatures. Creatures and objects within the dome when you cast this\
    \ spell can move through it freely. All other creatures and objects are barred\
    \ from passing through it. Spells and other magical effects can\u2019t extend\
    \ through the dome or be cast through it. The atmosphere inside the space is comfortable\
    \ and dry, regardless of the weather outside.\nUntil the spell ends, you can command\
    \ the interior to become dimly lit or dark. The dome is opaque from the outside,\
    \ of any color you choose, but it is transparent from the inside."
