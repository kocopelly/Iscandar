    \ to shatter its intellect and personality. The target takes 4d6 psychic damage\
    \ and must make an Intelligence saving throw.\nOn a failed save, the creature\u2019\
    s Intelligence and Charisma scores become 1. The creature can\u2019t cast spells,\
    \ activate magic items, understand language, or communicate in any intelligible\
    \ way. The creature can, however, identify its friends, follow them, and even\
    \ protect them.\nAt the end of every 30 days, the creature can repeat its saving\
    \ throw against this spell. If it succeeds on its saving throw, the spell ends.\n\
