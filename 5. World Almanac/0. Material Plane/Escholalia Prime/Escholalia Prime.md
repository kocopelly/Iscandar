# Escholalia Prime

Escholalia Prime, the home world of the Nexus of Echolalia, is an enigma even to the most advanced civilizations. It is a place where the physical and the ethereal merge, where the collective consciousness of the Nexus resides. The planet is enclosed by a gigantic structure known as a Dyson Sphere, a Matrioshka Brain, designed to capture and utilize every joule of energy from its star.

The Dyson Sphere is a testament to the technological prowess of the Nexus. It is made up of countless nanobots, constantly shifting and adapting to optimize energy capture and usage. The interior is a massive digital landscape, where the formless energy beings of the Nexus exist and interact with one another.
