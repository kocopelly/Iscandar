# Emberhold

Emberhold, the second-largest city in the Expanse, is renowned for its vast mines and forges. As the heart of the region's mineral wealth, it plays a significant role in the Expanse's economy.

## Economy and Industry

Emberhold's economy is driven by its mining industry. The city's vast mines yield a variety of precious metals and minerals, which are then worked in its numerous forges. This has led to Emberhold becoming a center for metalwork and craftsmanship, with goods from Emberhold being highly sought after throughout the Expanse.

## Governance and Politics

The Council, a democratic body composed of representatives from various factions within the city, governs Emberhold. The Council seeks to guide the Expanse into a new era of peace and prosperity. This democratic approach is a stark contrast to the power struggles seen in other cities.

## Social Climate

Despite the hard work associated with the mining industry, Emberhold has a strong sense of community. The citizens take pride in their city's contributions to the Expanse and share a common vision of a prosperous future guided by the Council.
