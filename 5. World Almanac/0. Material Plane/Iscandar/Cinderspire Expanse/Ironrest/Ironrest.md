# Ironrest

Ironrest is a bustling port city located on the West Coast of the Cinderspire Expanse. Known for its shipbuilding industry and robust maritime trade, the city boasts a rich seafaring culture. The [[Iron Guild]], an influential group of shipbuilders and merchants, governs the city. Ironrest is home to a diverse mix of humans, dwarves, and halflings.

## Maritime Trade and Shipbuilding

Ironrest's prime location along the [[Iron Channel]] makes it a vital hub for maritime trade in the Expanse. The city's thriving shipbuilding industry, overseen by the Iron Guild, produces some of the finest vessels in the region. This industry has shaped the city's culture, with many of its inhabitants working in jobs related to shipbuilding and trade.

## Conflict with the Forgeborn Collective

Ironrest's prosperity has not come without challenges. The city finds itself at odds with the [[Forgeborn Collective]], a faction seeking to monopolize iron-working in the Expanse. This conflict has sparked tension within the city, and its resolution remains a significant concern for the city's leadership.

## Beliefs and Ideals

Ironrest's inhabitants predominantly worship gods of the sea and trade, reflecting the city's maritime culture. The city values hard work, resilience, and innovation, traits that have allowed it to prosper despite its challenging environment.
