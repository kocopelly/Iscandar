# Cinderforge

Cinderforge, the heart of the [[Cinderspire Expanse]], is a city built on the ashes of a war-torn past. The fall of [[Pyrothar]], the draconic dictator, has left a power vacuum that various factions vie to fill. The city stands divided, its present and future uncertain, as the autocratic [[Blazeborn Dynasty]] clings to power.

## Social and Political Climate

The political climate in Cinderforge is as volatile as the molten ore forges that fuel its economy. The newly installed Blazeborn Dynasty claims control through divine right but struggles to maintain its grasp over the sprawling city. It staunchly denies the oligarchic reality that has taken hold, where different factions with significant resources and influence play substantial roles in the city's governance.

The [[Emberhold Council]], composed of prominent individuals from wealthy backgrounds, opposes the Dynasty's rule. They present a facade of progressive leadership but are no less power-hungry than their opponents. They advocate for a plutocracy, subtly hinting at keeping power in the hands of the wealthy, important, and influential.

Other power players include the [[Highlake Council]], an assembly of affluent nobles and landowners renowned for their diplomatic skills. This group of individuals retired to the serene [[Highlake]] region and wish to maintain their power without disrupting their peace. Their support for the Emberhold Council has led to a steady alliance that the Blazeborn Dynasty cannot ignore.

On the other end of the spectrum, the [[Underminers]], once a mere miners union, have grown more radical over time. Fueled by economic disparity and the dreams of a workers' revolution, they've begun to gather significant support among the city's disenfranchised.

The [[Emberhold Mining Consortium]] and the [[Stormbreak Alliance]] represent two other power factions with different goals. The former wields economic influence through their control of mineral resources and the latter, an outsider faction, seeks to establish a political foothold in Cinderforge, valuing elemental balance above all.

The city is also under threat from external forces. The specter of Pyrothar's return looms large, while bandits and criminals once held at bay by the dragon's rule now pose a constant danger. This ongoing strife and uncertainty shape Cinderforge's climate, making it a city teetering on the edge of a knife.

## Districts and Economic Divisions

Cinderforge is divided into districts, each reflecting the economic disparity of its inhabitants. The wealthy District of Embers, at the city's heart, houses the city's nobility and affluent individuals. Here, grand manors and opulent establishments stand in stark contrast to the city's poorer districts like the Ashen Quarters, where miners and laborers reside in overcrowded, subpar conditions.

The control over resources and wealth has led to political maneuvering and power plays, with factions like the Emberhold Mining Consortium gaining influence. The Underminers find significant support in the poorer districts, with many residents seeing them as the only hope for improved living conditions and fair treatment.

## Governance and Major Factions

>[!column|no-t] 
>**[[Blazeborn Dynasty]]**
>The governance of Cinderforge is currently dominated by the [[Blazeborn Dynasty]], a family with historical ties to Pyrothar and a strong grasp on the city's foundries. Under the leadership of [[Blazelord Mykos]], the dynasty is in a state of transition as they attempt to navigate the city's political complexities. Although publicly adhering to a divine-right autocracy model, Mykos dreams of a philosopher's kingdom, causing internal tensions within the family and adding a level of uncertainty to Cinderforge's political landscape. The Blazeborn's control over the production and trade of weapons and armor provides them an economic edge, yet also a target for those who wish to challenge their power.<br>
>**[[Emberhold Council]]** 
>The Emberhold Council acts as a counterbalance to the Blazeborn Dynasty, advocating for a more meritocratic and knowledge-based society. Although originally a diverse political entity, the council's current leadership, comprised of industry magnate [[Gallus Giltroot]] and scholarly philanthropist [[Zephyra Quill]], promotes economic development and education reform respectively. The council's influence and reputation vary among the population, as their progressive ideals often clash with traditionalist views.

>**[[Emberhold Mining Consortium]]** 
>The Emberhold Mining Consortium, led by [[Gallus Giltroot]], is a powerful economic entity in Cinderforge. Giltroot's inventive extraction methods revolutionized the mining industry, propelling the Consortium to the forefront of the city's economic scene. Although they're a major employer and a significant part of the city's wealth, their harsh working conditions and ecological disregard have earned them many enemies, especially among the city's laborers and environmentalists. <br><br><br>
>**[[Underminers]]** 
>An anarchistic organization, the Underminers, led by [[Dorik Hammerfall]], emerged as a response to the Consortium's ruthless business practices. Initially a peaceful protest movement formed by miners, the group has evolved into a more militant faction, advocating for workers' rights and challenging the city's existing power structures. Their decentralized organizational structure, secret bases in underground mines, and growing popularity among the city's working class make them a potent force of opposition and an unpredictable factor in Cinderforge's political landscape.
