# Pyrothar's Keep

Pyrothar's Keep, once the abode of Pyrothar, is located within an active volcano near [[Cinderforge]]. Despite its sparse population, the Keep holds great historical significance and is a site of pilgrimage for the Pyroclastic Order, a religious faction dedicated to the worship of Pyrothar. The [[Draconic Vanguard]], a group seeking to return the Expanse to draconic rule, also lays claim to the Keep.

## Historical Significance

As the former residence of Pyrothar, the Keep is a monument to the dragon's influence over the Expanse. It serves as a potent reminder of Pyrothar's reign and the power that dragons once wielded. It is a place of pilgrimage for those who revere Pyrothar, especially members of the Pyroclastic Order.

## Conflict with the Draconic Vanguard

While the [[Pyroclastic Order]] sees the Keep as a religious site, the [[Draconic Vanguard]] views it as a symbol of their cause. This difference in perspective has led to tension between the two factions, with each laying claim to the Keep.

## Beliefs and Ideals

The residents of Pyrothar's Keep, primarily humans, dragonborn, and tieflings, predominantly worship Pyrothar. They value the Keep's historical significance and are dedicated to preserving its legacy. Many of them share the Pyroclastic Order's belief in Pyrothar's return and the restoration of draconic rule.
