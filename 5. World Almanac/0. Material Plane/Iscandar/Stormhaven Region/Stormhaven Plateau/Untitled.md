# Stormseekers

The Stormseekers are a faction within Windspire that is dedicated to understanding the magic of the storms. They believe that the storm's magic is a gift from Tempestar and seek to harness its power for the betterment of society. Composed of scholars, sages, and storm mages, the Stormseekers devote their lives to studying the Great Gale and its manifestations.

While their research often intertwines with the technology brought by the Saurians, they perceive it through a mystical lens. The power to control the weather, in their eyes, is a form of communion with the gods, a sacred right bestowed upon the worthy. They are particularly interested in the devices brought by the dragons, which they believe are divine relics.

# Technohermits

The Technohermits, on the other hand, are a faction of technologists, engineers, and historians who are dedicated to unraveling the secrets of ancient technology. They study the artifacts brought by the dragons and the Saurian mercenaries, as well as the devices carried to Iscandar on the Escholalian Genetic Ark.

The Technohermits believe that this technology is the key to understanding the world and advancing society. Unlike the Stormseekers, they perceive technology as a tool rather than a divine gift. They strive to demystify the technology, reverse-engineering devices to understand their workings and replicate their effects.

The Technohermits have a certain level of skepticism towards the religious interpretation of the storms' magic. They believe that the power of the storms can be explained and controlled through scientific understanding, not divine intervention.

The two factions coexist in a state of respectful disagreement, often engaging in intellectual debates that fuel the advancement of knowledge within Windspire. Despite their differing perspectives, both factions contribute significantly to the city's reputation as a hub of knowledge and discovery.
