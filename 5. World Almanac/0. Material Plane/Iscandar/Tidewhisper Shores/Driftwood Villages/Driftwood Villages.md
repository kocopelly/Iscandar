# Driftwood Villages

## Overview

The Driftwood Villages are a collection of independent villages located close to Tidereach. They are named for their unique homes, constructed from the plentiful driftwood washed ashore. The villages are known for their skilled fisherfolk and are a vital source of seafood for the region.

## Society and Culture

The Driftwood Villages are primarily populated by humans, half-elves, and tritons. They are governed by a council of tribal elders, with Elder Thalos currently presiding. The Driftwood Folk, the villages' controlling faction, uphold their independence fiercely.

While not directly under the influence of the Order of the Tidewhisper, many of the Driftwood Folk respect and adhere to the teachings of Aquarion, acknowledging the dragon's guardianship over the sea and its creatures.

## Notable Locations

The Driftwood Markets, where fresh seafood and unique driftwood crafts are sold, are a significant attraction. The Elder's Hut, where the council meets, is a large driftwood structure at the heart of the main village. The Ocean Shrine, a simple but beautiful tribute to Aquarion, is found at the edge of the shore.
